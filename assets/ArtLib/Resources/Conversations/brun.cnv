[Brun]
Say=Are you sure you have enough experience to walk to South Gate?  It's no place for amateurs.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'll be all right.  Let me pass.
NxtLn1=Brun1
RspTxt2=Where are you from?
NxtLn2=Brun2
RspTxt3=Have you heard any rumors?
NxtLn3=Brun3

[Brun1]
Say=Fine then, but if you get yourself skewered by an Ahoul arrow, don't say I didn't warn you!
RspDflt=Pardon me, I must be going.
rspBack=Brun

[Brun2]
Say=I'm Cathean by birth.  I came here to make a name for myself before returning home in glory.  Now, I fear none of us may see our homes again.
RspDflt=Keep heart, soldier.  We will triumph.
rspBack=Brun

[Brun3]
Say=I hear the Peasants' Bailey is growing littered with the dead and starving.  We need relief soon or we will never last.
RspDflt=The good spirits will protect us.  Good day to you.
rspBack=Brun

[chalice]
Say=So you are he, eh?  Is it true you found the Chalice of Life?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Yes.  I almost lost my neck in the search, too!
NxtLn1=chalice1
RspTxt2=What's the news around here?
NxtLn2=chalice2

[chalice1]
Say=Well, I'm glad you managed to keep it!
RspDflt=Thank you.
rspBack=chalice

[chalice2]
Say=The Ahoul supposedly got more reinforcements.  It won't make a difference, though.  Once King Vortigerm arrives at the helm of his great army, they won't stand a chance!
RspDflt=Pardon me, I must be leaving.
rspBack=chalice

[three]
Say=Vortigerm's armies should be arriving within the next few days, right?  I can't wait to break this siege!  There's no good ale here, just some swill and that gut-wrenching stuff Gentza comes up with every once in a while.
RspDflt=I agree, soldier.  Take care of yourself.

[fourplus]
Say=Any time now...  I can feel it.  Vortigerm will be here, and we will have nothing to worry about!  The infantry will save us!
RspDflt=Soon, soldier, soon.  Farewell.

[Soldier]
Say=What do you need?
RspTxt1=And where are you from, soldier?
NxtLn1=Soldier1
RspTxt2=I'd like to hear a good rumor.
NxtLn2=Soldier2

[Soldier1]
Say=I've come from Aratoy, and I miss the forests there terribly.  This fortress is so cold to me compared to the life of the wilderness back home.  That's why I keep plants next to my bunk in the barracks.  This place is nearly enough to suck the life out of you.  I can't wait until I can go outside again.

[Soldier2]
Say=I've nothing of value.  Then again, it's doubtful whether rumors are helpful at all.  At least they... sometimes... keep spirits up.

[Chalice]
Say=Hello, sir, how may I help you?
RspTxt1=Where are you from, soldier?
NxtLn1=Chalice1
RspTxt2=I know an alert sort like you must hear a lot of rumors...
NxtLn2=Chalice2

[Chalice1]
Say=I come from Aratoy, the true jewel of all Eurale.  Once the Ahoul are crushed, I will return to the forests.  It's bad enough that I can't venture outside for fear of being impaled by an Ahoul arrow.
rspBack=chalice

[Chalice2]
Say=Only that the bowmen of Aratoy are ready for a fight!  We're eager to end the siege, end the war, and end the Ahoul once and for all!

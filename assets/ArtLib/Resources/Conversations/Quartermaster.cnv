[squire]
Say=What can I do for you, young squire?

RspTxt1=Greetings.  I am new here, and just received my commission.  I was told that you would be able to provide me with equipment?
nxtln1=squire1

[squire1]
Say=I'm short on chain mail at the moment, so a sturdy suit of leather armor will have to do.  For a weapon I can let you have a common long sword; we ran out of Officer's Swords over a month ago.

RspTxt1=I thank you, but I must say that this equipment does seem to be of poor quality.  Is there not anything better?
nxtln1=noletter

[hunter]
Say=Is there anything I can help you with, sir?

nxtln1=hunter1

[hunter1]
Say=Well, I have a fine leather jerkin to protect you from the early morning chill along with the odd arrow, and for hunting beyond Avalon's walls, I have just the thing.

nxtln1=apprentice1

[apprentice1]
Say=An old pig sticker is all I can give you.  If you want something better, you'll have to find it elsewhere.
RspDflt=none
Script=Siege20000600060052238420.giveitem(dagger,player);showmessage(You have received an item.,200);
RspTxt1=A dagger?  Is that all that you have for me?
nxtLn1=noletter

[noletter]
Say=Sorry, lad.  General Roth has ordered me to hold most of the arms distributions so we can prepare for an assault.  You don't think I like seeing anyone -- even new recruits -- go so poorly armed, do you?  It's this damned shortage of good steel.
RspDflt=I understand.  Good day.
RspTxt1=So where can I find better equipment, then?
nxtLn1=Steel
rspCnd2=all(ttl(01StolenRations));
RspTxt2=I heard something about rations being stolen.  Do you know anything about that?
nxtLn2=Stolen

[Stolen]
Say=Not really.  Anora -- she's the head cook -- just mentioned that food in the kitchen's basement was going missing.
Adventure=ch1-07;
RspDflt=I see.  Thanks for your time.
RspTxt1=Do you have any idea where can I find better equipment, then?
nxtLn1=Steel

[Steel]
Say=These days, I don't really know, but maybe Lucan can help you out.  He's out in the Armory by the South Gate, past the Outer Bailey.  I wouldn't count on it, though, lad.  I also hear there are a few merchants in the Outer Bailey, but if the military doesn't have proper equipment, I don't see how commoners could.
Adventure=ch1-06;
RspDflt=I guess I shall try asking Lucan, then.  I thank you for your time.

[qmthreetofive]
Say=Good day, lad.  Judging by your equipment, I'd say you don't need any of my meager wares.
RspDflt=Err, I suppose not, quartermaster.  Please pardon my intrusion.

[qmsix]
Say=There's a stillness in the air, lad.  I can't say as I like it.  Everyone feels it now, and I believe we're sitting in the eye of the storm.  To be sure, I have been busy maintaining even the meager stores I have.  The blade that is not sharp cannot cleave a Sha'ahoul head from its shoulders.
RspDflt=Well said, quartermaster.  If you'll pardon me, I must be about my duties...

[qmpt]
Say=Go get them, %playername%!  Lop off their heads and dance on the fallen!
RspDflt=I wouldn't go that far, quartermaster, although your enthusiasm is appreciated.  Pardon me.

[Soldier]
Say=Are you lost, boy?  This is the Officers' Barracks.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm not lost, just new.  I was looking around, trying to get to know the citadel.
NxtLn1=Soldier1

[Soldier1]
Say=Well, don't be in too much of a hurry.  Little enough changes around here and I promise you'll have plenty of time to learn the citadel.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Perhaps.  I feel the winds of change in Avalon though.
NxtLn1=Soldier2
RspTxt2=I'm just eager to learn about Avalon, that's all.
NxtLn2=Soldier3

[Soldier2]
Say=Are you having a foretelling?  Are you Fornaxan born?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=No.  I'm not having a foretelling and I come from Elythria.  It's just a feeling I have.  When we sailed into Avalon I got a feeling in the pit of my stomach...
NxtLn1=Soldier4

[Soldier4]
Say=That was just seasickness, lad!  Only Nisosans have proper sea-legs.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Would you be from Nisos then?
NxtLn1=Soldier5
RspTxt2=I may not be Nisosan, but I don't lose my stomach aboard a ship.
NxtLn2=Soldier6

[Soldier5]
Say=Of course!  Outlanders speak of Nisosans as if they are scoundrels and thieves.  They're not quite wrong either!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Should I distrust Nisosans?
NxtLn1=Soldier7

[Soldier7]
Say=On the walls of Avalon, no.  In a game of dice, of course!  We may pick your pocket, but we all fight the Ahoul together.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I suppose that's comforting.  Tell me, do you know Captain Nicophorus?
NxtLn1=Soldier8
RspTxt2=That rhymes with the things I've heard of your countrymen so far.
NxtLn2=Soldier9

[Soldier8]
Say=I've heard the name here and there.  Why do you ask?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I sailed here aboard his ship.  He's a fine Captain.
NxtLn1=Soldier10

[Soldier10]
Say=Perhaps the best in all Nisos.  I heard his ship took a quite a beating.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Yes, but we were lucky.  None other survived the trip upriver.
NxtLn1=Soldier11

[Soldier11]
Say=I'd heard as much.  A bad omen, lad.  A very bad omen.
RspDflt=Yes.  Well, I must begin my training.  Good luck to you.

[Soldier9]
Say=HA! HA!  Our reputations precede us!  At least they are not telling lies about us.  Calling us honest tradesmen and such.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Your people are not honest?
NxtLn1=Soldier12

[Soldier12]
Say=Of course not!  We scrape our lives out raiding trader's vessels and tricking drunk sailors in harborside bars!  But I suppose that is unfair.  Not all Nisosans are buccaneers.  There are craftsmen and honest merchants among us.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Of course.  Just as all Catheans are not horse farmers.
NxtLn1=Soldier13

[Soldier13]
Say=Exactly.  A little advice though.  Watch your back around Nisosans here or else you might find some personal things missing.
RspDflt=Thanks for the suggestion.  I'll keep it in mind.  Good day.

[Soldier6]
Say=Keeping your guts about you and having a sturdy pair of sea-legs are two different things, lad.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I don't doubt your word.  But I thought I did all right aboard the ship.
NxtLn1=Soldier14

[Soldier14]
Say=Maybe.  There's a solid look to you.  In fact, you remind me of an officer I've fought with...
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=That would be my brother Corvus.
NxtLn1=Soldier15

[Soldier15]
Say=That's it.  You have his size and color.  If you're of the same blood, then I don't doubt you'll do well here in Avalon.
RspDflt=Thank you.  Good day.

[Soldier3]
Say=Eager, eh?  That will be hacked out of you after you see your first real siege engine.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I've seen siege work before... in books and tapestries.
NxtLn1=Soldier16

[Soldier16]
Say=There's a bit of a difference.  A book won't reach over the wall and stab you with a spear.  A tapestry doesn't smile when it tears your friend's arms off.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Oh, I understand.  I'm just saying that I'm not as green as you think.
NxtLn1=Soldier17

[Soldier17]
Say=You're green.  You'll live to regret your decision to come to Avalon.  If you're one of the lucky ones, you may even die quickly.  If you're one of the unlucky ones, you'll watch a dozen of your friends die before the Ahoul take you.  It's no story you've walked into, lad.
RspDflt=I know and I won't disappoint anyone.  Good day.

[chapter6]
Say=Ah, %playername%. I hope all is going as planned.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=It is as well as can be expected. The Sha'ahoul continue to gather in spots about the village.  I feel something is amiss.
nxtln1=chapter6a
RspTxt2=Of course all is well!  We continue to drive the Sha'ahoul away from our home.  Soon, the bards will sing stories of our great victory.
nxtln2=chapter6b

[chapter6a]
Say=With the Sha'ahoul, something is always amiss.  Keep alert.
RspDflt=And you too, friend.  Farewell.

[chapter6b]
Say=Save your hope, son.  We both know what can happen here.  Let's do our best to help the situation.
RspDflt=Understood.  Farewell, friend.

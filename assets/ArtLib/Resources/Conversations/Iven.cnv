[Iven]
Say=You've the look of a newcomer.  Are you lost?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=No.  I was just exploring a bit.
NxtLn1=Iven1
RspTxt2=Not at all.  Just introducing myself to my fellow soldiers.  Who are you and where are you from?
NxtLn2=Iven2
RspTxt3=Nope, just hunting for rumors.  Have you heard any lately?
NxtLn3=Iven3

[Iven1]
Say=Well, don't wander about much.  Make yourself useful.
RspDflt=I will.  Good day.
rspBack=Iven

[Iven2]
Say=I'm Iven from Nisos, sir.  I used to be a sailor before my boat was sent to the bottom.  When Nicophorus calls for me, I'll start sailing again with him.
RspDflt=Nicophorus is a good man.  I hope your wish is granted.
rspBack=Iven

[Iven3]
Say=Only the same frightened hogwash I've always been hearing.  Everyone is being too easily scared by the length of this siege.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Perhaps.  It is a frightening situation we are in.
NxtLn1=Iven4

[Iven4]
Say=True, but I have faith in our generals to make a success out of it.
RspDflt=Your faith is well placed, soldier.  Good day.
rspBack=Iven

[Chalice]
Say=How can I serve you, my lord?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Just passing through.  I hope everything is well.
NxtLn1=Chalice1
RspTxt2=You can tell me the latest rumor you've heard.
NxtLn2=Chalice2

[Chalice1]
Say=As well as can be, sir.  Good day to you.
RspDflt=Good day.
rspBack=Chalice

[Chalice2]
Say=I hear Captain Calvaric spit in the eye of Mithras the other day!  Is it true?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I suspect that one is false, but only out of circumstance.  If Calvaric were ever in the position, I'm sure he would spit at Mithras -- as would we all!
NxtLn1=Chalice3

[Chalice3]
Say=Too true, my lord!
RspDflt=Good day, soldier.
rspBack=Chalice

[three]
Say=Hello... [yawn] sir.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=If you're tired, you should chew on a tea leaf, soldier.  It will keep you awake.
nxtln1=three2

[three2]
Say=Oh, sure.  I'll just [yawn] pull out my Bag of Endless Tea Leaves and start gnawing away.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I see your point.  It has been quite a while since any of us have been with the comforts of the lives we used to have before the cursed campfire.
nxtln1=three3

[three3]
Say=What would you know about that?  You're an officer and the brother of the famed Lieutenant Corvus!
RspDflt=Very well, soldier.  If that is the way you choose to see it, farewell.
RspTxt1=What about my appearance fooled you, soldier?  Was it my fingers bedecked with golden rings, my scepter studded with pearls?  Was it the wake of a dozen personal attendants that seem to follow me everywhere?
nxtln1=three4

[three4]
Say=Hah, good one, sir.
RspDflt=That's what I thought.  Stay safe, soldier.

[chapter6]
Say=Hail, brother of Corvus.
RspDflt=Hail, soldier.

[Quests]
Ch1-00=It hardly seems fair that when I have only just found my brother, he is again forced to leave me.  Duty beckons, however, and its call is irresistible.  General Ovoron will, I'm certain, see that my brother is returned safely to me.  The commission that Corvus secured for me will, however, allow me to remain in Avalon until his return.  I may even prove to be of some use around here!
Ch1-01=Elarath the wizard makes his home in the northeast corner of the second floor of the Outer Keep.  He seems kind, and most willing to instruct soldiers who wish to pursue the art of magic.  Should I ever wish to learn more of his craft, I will return.
Ch1-02=Mudam is the Master of Scouts in Avalon and his chambers are in the southwest corner of the Outer Keep's second floor.  With his scouting corps taking many casualties recently, he is very eager to recruit more people to serve as scouts.  Even if I don't wish to become a scout, I'm sure he would be most willing to teach me the tricks of his trade.
Ch1-03=Sir Roth's chambers are in the northwest corner of the second floor of the Outer Keep.  The guards stationed outside the room inform me that I shall need special permission to speak with him.
Ch1-04=Lord Harold seems an impatient, boorish individual.  I think I shall avoid him.
Ch1-05=Heather is a pretty enough creature but this is not my keep back home.  I am sure she has other companions and other engagements so inviting her to my bed would likely be quite useless.
Ch1-06=The Quartermaster on the second floor of the Outer Keep informed me that there seems to be a shortage of good steel and so the equipment he was able to provide me with is of poor quality.  For better arms, he suggested that I seek out Lucan, in the South Gate Armory.  The South Gate lies past the Outer Bailey.
Ch1-07=There is a rumor that something is thieving food from the kitchens.
Ch1-08=Madden is a lonely soldier from Aratoy.  I last saw him standing outside the Quartermaster's door, looking lost.  He informed me that someone stole a love letter of his from beneath his pillow.  Why would someone steal something so precious?
Ch1-09=I have been told that the young King Vortigerm from Taberland is on his way to Avalon with an army to help break the siege.  The question, of course, is if Avalon will still be standing when he arrives.
Ch1-10=Kent believes that the only way that Avalon will be saved is if every soldier remains strong under the pressure of the siege.  It is certainly a realistic sentiment.
Ch1-11=I have been told by Kent that he stole a love letter from Madden, a fellow soldier, in an effort to get Madden to forget about his lover and concentrate on his duty to Avalon.  The letter is hidden in Kent's room and while he insisted that he would return the letter to Madden once the crisis is past, I do not know that I like this.
Ch1-12=After some deliberation, I have returned the love letter to Kent.  We must all be strong, Madden included, and it seems to me that this is the only way to truly help Madden.
Ch1-13=I recovered the love letter and returned it to Madden.  While it is true that strength is required in these difficult times, it is also true that we all draw our strength from different places.  Madden's strength lies in memories of his love.  Mine lies in duty: to my brother, to my country, to Avalon and, most of all, to myself.
Ch1-14=Madden and Kent fought in the corridor right in front of me.  They were both taken to the infirmary, but it looked to me as if Madden would die anyway.  It was a mistake for me to tell Madden that Kent was the one who stole his letter.
Ch1-15=Friar Massus is the monk who runs the chapel.  He seems nice enough, and suggested that should I ever need healing, I should seek out Brother Crosby in the infirmary.
Ch1-16=Friar Massus told me that he knows my brother fairly well from the time he has had to spend in the infirmary recovering from wounds.  While the friar and the other monks are good people, it would be best if I didn't get to know them as well as Corvus.  Or at least not for the same reason.
Ch1-17=The Chalice of Life is a minor magical artifact, possibly with some healing capabilities.  The peasants believe that the loss of the Chalice when the village was abandoned foretells the eventual fall of Avalon, but I am sure this cannot be true.
Ch1-18=The Chalice is not only raising the morale of all of Avalon, but also helping the healers save more lives.  It is truly a miracle that Corvus not only returned safely to Avalon, but brought the Chalice with him.
Ch1-19=The Heal spell can only help with injury, not sickness.  I shall have to keep this is mind, though it is more likely that I shall fall in battle and not succumb to some disease.
Ch1-20=Corvus is, of course, likely wounded.  However, with the amount of time that has passed it is also probable that he has also been infected with a fever.  Brother Mo says that eating of the raw fruit of the herb I recovered will help with such a thing, possibly enough to keep Corvus alive until I return him to Avalon.
Ch1-21=Brother Crosby in the infirmary has offered to heal me should I ever require it.  No offense to the monk, but I hope I do not.
Ch1-22=I have left Corvus in the capable hands of Brother Crosby.  I hope that he grows well soon.  Avalon needs everyone possible, especially one of my brother's stature.
Ch1-23=I helped put down a prison break today.  It seems incomprehensible to me that with the situation Avalon is in, some would still fight against their fellows.
Ch1-24=I met Bonnie today.  I would like to say that she has quite an imagination, but something in her eyes makes me not so certain.  This tale of hers about a Shade in the kitchen cellar might be worth investigating, even if only so that I might have something with which to converse with her later.
Ch1-25=Bonnie offered to set aside a portion of supper for me.  It is truly amusing that her words seem the best reward I have yet been given!
Ch1-26=I have left Bonnie happy, something that, oddly, makes me happy as well.
Ch1-27=I was told by Davet of a kitchen maid named Bonnie who claims she saw a Shade.  Most interesting.  Perhaps I will speak with her.
Ch1-28=I am not certain how appropriate it is to assign repair work to soldiers, but I must admit I have not seen any general laborers about and Davet's duties seem nonexistent.  Truth be told, however, I enjoyed bullying him into repairing the wall.
Ch1-29=The head cook Anora is brusque and unfriendly, but she seems to have had a hard life and her job grows more difficult with each passing meal.  I find myself unable to blame her for her attitude.
Ch1-30=Something is thieving food from the kitchen's stores.  With the Ahoul outside Avalon's walls, the food shortage will not be resolved any time soon and the Ahoul could hardly choose a better method of ending the siege than by starving Avalon even more quickly than we already are.  I would suspect their handiwork, but how could they possibly get into the middle of Avalon?
Ch1-31=There was an air of desperation about the training ground, as if it was foremost in the minds of all the soldiers practicing there that this moment might be the last moment they would have to hone their skills to the point where they could survive an encounter with the Ahoul.  The only difference between it and a real battlefield was the lack of dead soldiers soaking the ground in blood.
Ch1-32=The stench of the tanner's trade is present throughout the Outer Bailey, but as much as it repelled me, I still found myself speaking with him.  He had some items for sale, but I imagine a lack of raw materials -- mostly hide, I suppose -- plagues his business as much as a lack of steel would plague the blacksmith.
Ch1-33=Olon the Quick is the name of one of the merchants in the Outer Bailey; however, he all but admitted to me that he is a former thief.  With the siege severely limiting the opportunities for theft, though, he now seems to deal in other things, primarily the exchange of information.  I have little enough coin that I fear that had I a need for information, I could not afford his services.  He did, however, mention that an associate of his, Holt, could be found near South Gate's Armory, and had decent equipment available for purchase.
Ch1-34=As friendly as Olon seems, I think it would be wise to be wary of him.  The breadth of his knowledge is almost frightening and I do not doubt that should he wish anything, he would be able to acquire it by fair means or foul.  I will admit, however, that he does appear honorable; if I do not cross him, he should not cross me.
Ch1-35=Mudam and Olon seem to have a bit of history together.  I wonder what has transpired between them?
Ch1-36=Olon's tone was different when he was talking about Pellandrian: softer, or perhaps more concerned somehow.  I believe him when he calls her a friend, and I believe that if I was able to help her, he would help me in return.
Ch1-37=I am forced to wonder how Olon knew about the intact nature of the house, who the house really belonged to, and the remainder of the contents of that chest.  It is unlikely that I shall ever know.
Ch1-38=I have been warned by Olon that the boots in the chest are not magical so much as cursed.  I should avoid them if possible, and avoid wearing them at all costs.
Ch1-39=The mysterious chest in Olon's house contained more than just a pair of magical boots, which were left there no doubt so that no one would investigate further into the chest.  Hidden under a secret panel were papers detailing a conspiracy to infect Avalon's population with a deadly plague.  Olon was the chief conspirator behind this plot, for which he would receive a fortune from the Ahoul.  It is no wonder that he wanted the chest secured.  This might even be the cause of the fever running throughout the infirmary.  I must report this to Mudam and General Roth at once.
Ch1-40= Pellandrian -- Pell -- seems so sorrowful and yet so determined.  Somehow her ability to burn down Ahoul with ease instills in me no fear, but rather wonder and respect.  She would be a powerful ally to have by my side.  I do not understand this Lahren: if a creature like this were mine for the asking, I would not hesitate even the span of a heartbeat.  I find that in good conscience I have no choice but to assist her in her plight, and if that includes shaking sense into Lahren, then so be it.
Ch1-41=Pell has taught me to cast Shadow, a spell she says will help me avoid detection.  Being friends with a Fornaxan mage has its rewards -- and risks as well, considering what I agreed to do for her.
Ch1-42=I told Pell that I wished someday to be in love like she is with Lahren.  While I have seen her sadness, however, and wonder if I spoke the truth, I also think on her happiness and I know I did.
Ch1-43=Lahren reminded me of a petulant puppy.  While I refrained from grabbing him and rattling his teeth together, I needed to be rather abrupt with him to capture and hold his attention while I forced him to face his feelings.
Ch1-44=Lahren seemed to be caught by the utter fear of perhaps having poisoned his entire life with one thoughtless action.  It took some wheedling, but I believe I have led him around to the truth of his feelings and what he should do about them.
Ch1-45=I find it odd that with his obvious fear of magic Lahren was once a mage.  Something horrible must have happened to trigger this in him, forcing him to become a linguist and storyteller, but I have no clue what.
Ch1-46="I'm no Bloody Rose," indeed!  Pell is, in fact, dressed from head to toe in blue, so it came as no surprise to me when Lahren informed me that blue is her favorite color.
Ch1-47=One of the Ahoul scrolls I found contains a set of orders regarding the capture of a "dirtman" fleeing through the village.  This lends me hope that they have not yet captured my brother.
Ch1-48=Another Ahoul scroll contains instructions for keeping everyone away from the Church.  Apparently, all available Ahoul are wandering the village tonight.  I had thought there were an unusually high number of them about.
Ch1-49=Some large creature seems to have been sealed in the Library's basement by the Ahoul.  They also suspect that my brother may be trapped in there as well.  I think I may have finally found him, but this creature is causing me to worry further.
Ch1-50=It pains me to even write this, but one of the scrolls I took off the Sha'men's body was parchment and not hide, and seems to have been written with common ink, not whatever the Ahoul use to mark their pages.  I would guess some Avalonian sent a message to the Sha'men, but I cannot truly believe it.
Ch1-51=Freeman, the blacksmith in the Outer Bailey, confirmed to me that he had no good steel with which to work.  The siege has taken its toll on everyone and everything.  We are left with a single gruesome question: which will run out first, our weaponry or our food stores?
Ch1-52=It seems that Freeman has hidden away a quality blade.  It seems unfair that to acquire the sword I am being forced to perform a task that has been previously refused by Mudam, but if the smith is correct about the cache, it will be a boon to all of Avalon.  Duty and desire coincide in this instance, an ironic fact of which I'm certain Freeman is aware.
Ch1-53=Sir Penrith introduced himself to me in the Outer Bailey today.  He was once Corvus' commander, until Corvus earned his own cohort.  Corvus has made many friends in Avalon; I hope I am as successful as he.
Ch1-54=Corvus is dead.  Penrith told me that the watch in the South Gate witnessed him take an Ahoul arrow to the throat.  If I cannot rescue my brother, then by the spirits I shall avenge him!
Ch1-55=Lost...  My brother has been lost.  Search parties were sent out, but General Ovoron's troop is presumed destroyed.  Sir Penrith suggested that I speak with Calum and the lookouts in the South Gate.  They may have seen something in the village.
Ch1-56=Sir Penrith is reluctant to commit men to ferrying back the steel bars from the village if it means risking their lives.  It is out of duty that he does this, and his is an example that I would do well to emulate.  He has told me that he would be at my side searching for Corvus if only duty permitted.  For him, though, it does not.  I am glad that my own duty is to seek out Corvus; in my heart I know not what I would do if duty forbade it.
Ch1-57=Tomik warned me that venturing into the South Gate, and especially beyond, was not for those eager for long lives.  The Gate could come under assault at any time, and the village outside is infested with Ahoul.  I believe that he was merely trying to frighten a new recruit but still I shall keep myself ready for deadly combat.
Ch1-58=It is tempting in many ways to look down upon Lahren, but scholars like him are as vital to Avalon's cause as any warrior.  Practically anyone can swing a sword, but how many can decipher Ahoul documents?
Ch1-59=The merchants in the Outer Bailey have some pretty things to be sure, but little that would keep my skin intact.  I shall have to look elsewhere for better equipment.
Ch1-60=It may not yet be the stink of death that wafts through the gates from the Peasants' Bailey, but I imagine death would smell no worse.  Lord Harold has ordered the Peasants' Bailey sealed and while I may not be certain I agree with that decision, I am certain that I have no wish to venture beyond those gates and witness the exact source of that odor.
Ch1-61=One of the men in the South Gate snapped for apparently no reason.  He hauled out his sword and started swinging mindlessly.  I helped put him down before he was able to kill any of the other soldiers, but people's holds on sanity are truly precarious here.
Ch1-62=Apparently there is a sort of scratching sound coming from the basement of South Gate.  Perhaps there is another infestation of beetles?
Ch1-63=I met Holt today.  I doubt he is the most honest person inside Avalon, but he has a cache of quality arms and armor.  His prices may be high -- naturally -- but he seems to be the sole source of decent equipment, equipment my duty may require me to possess.  If I had the money, I might find myself doing business with him.
Ch1-64=The guards outside the stairs leading to the basement of the South Gate are there on General Ovoron's orders, apparently.  There is speculation that they and others down below are clearing out a suspected infestation, but they refuse to reveal exactly why they are there.  It is possible, however, that they simply do not know and are merely following orders to let no one downstairs.
Ch1-65=A strange creature erupted from below the South Gate.  The poor guards standing there were cut in half almost immediately.  It took myself and several other guards to subdue and destroy the monster, but in the end we succeeded.  Surprisingly, even Holt lent a hand.  The question now is where that thing came from...
Ch1-66=Lucan is the armorer in the South Gate.  In addition to maintaining armor and weaponry, he also trains warriors in the better use of their equipment.  Perhaps I could learn something from him?
Ch1-67=Lucan reports that the blacksmith has been making little of quality during the last while.  This is due to a shortage of steel, of course.  Everything is in short supply, making me -- and every other Avalonian -- wonder how long we can hold out.
Ch1-68=Calum has told me that the lookouts spotted Corvus running through the village, being pursued by an Ahoul hunting party.  They know not if he was killed, but since he was alive when he vanished from their sight, I choose to believe that he may still be alive.  To find him, however, I need to venture out into the village,  and for that, I need permission.  Calum suggested that I speak with Sir Roth.  If anyone can permit me access to the village, it would be him.  Calum also suggested I speak with Elazar, another wizard who is located just up the corridor from Calum.  Perhaps he has information unavailable to merely mortal eyes.
Ch1-69=The lookouts above the South Gate told me of strange happenings from around the village Library and the old Church.  I must beware these places when I enter the village to seek out Corvus.
Ch1-70=Elazar the wizard has given me the most precious of news: as of this moment, my brother yet lives.
Ch1-71=Elazar was most amused by my assertion that Elarath informed me the amulet I seek was lost in the village.  He then proceeded to hand it to me, telling me he had it in his keeping all along.  If I was not so weary, I might find this amusing.
Ch1-72=The underground city is apparently mortally dangerous.  Elazar has warned me away from it.  I understand his concern, but if I must scout out those lost tunnels then I shall.
Ch1-73=The wizard, Elarath, is researching some sort of portal.  While he did not go into details, he has told me that he requires a certain amulet to continue.  A portal to where, I wonder?  I would have asked, but his impatient, harried countenance prevented me from speaking with him further.
Ch1-74=Avalon was apparently built on the ruins of an ancient city, from which much of the stone used in Avalon's construction was taken.  All that remains of it, however, is a network of underground tunnels.
Ch1-75=Elarath claims that an amulet I found in the village is not the amulet which he seeks.  This is a disappointing conclusion to a dangerous search.  Elarath suggested I talk to Elazar, the wizard in the South Gate, about the appearance of the amulet, so that I may recognize it should I happen across it in further explorations of the village.
Ch1-76=Sir Roth does make an imposing impression but it is reassuring that the defense of Avalon rests in his hands.  I find myself very proud to have served under him, and I shall never be able to repay my debt to him for allowing me the chance to seek out Corvus.
Ch1-77=Sir Roth reacted very badly to the news that Ovoron is a traitor.  As well he might, with Ovoron knowing all he knows as a member of the council.  I cannot help thinking that while Sir Roth will do everything possible to minimize the damage this has caused Avalon, somehow I believe it will take even more than his efforts to save us all.
Ch1-78=While Sir Roth may have the authority to transfer me to Mudam's command, it was up to Mudam himself to decide if I should be allowed outside Avalon's walls.  Mudam's scouts have fared very poorly as of late, with almost all of them never reporting back.  I cannot help but think that as an inexperienced warrior I am ill-suited to the task at hand, but if I am Corvus' only hope then let come what may.  If I must learn, then I shall learn.  If I must grow, then that I shall do as well.  The Ahoul may leave me dead in the dust, but I will be damned by the spirits themselves ere I cry surrender.  As I owe a debt to Sir Roth, I also owe Mudam for allowing me to combine my duty to my family with my duty as a soldier.  For the rest of my days, as few or as many as they may be, I shall be grateful to both of them.
Ch1-79=I have reported to Mudam that Ahoul were attempting to tunnel into Avalon.  These are dangerous times, when the Ahoul would abandon their fundamental beliefs to destroy Avalon.
Ch1-80=The fact that men were tunneling out into the village has been reported to Mudam.  This entire affair sickens me to my core.
Ch1-81=There can be no doubt that the two groups of diggers were seeking to meet each other.  With perhaps mere hours remaining before the tunnels would have met, it was only luck that prevented disaster.  The spirits do watch over us, but will they be watching the next time?
Ch1-82=I have found Corvus.  I wish I could end this entry on that note but I must record something of even greater import.  While it is true that General Ovoron's troop was ambushed and destroyed, it is also true that the General --  No!  He is no general now!  It is also true that Ovoron and his staff turned traitor and led their men to the slaughter.  I know I must get both this information and Corvus back to Avalon, but that a human could sacrifice so many lives for so putrid a cause...  I am left feeling empty.  I know not what more to write, and not even what to think.
Ch1-83=My duty is complete for now;  I have done all I may until the day dawns anew.  My time here in Avalon has been strange and frightening, and as I return to my chambers for sleep, I feel no shame in admitting that I fear what dreams may visit me.  "A new chapter," Mudam said.  A new chapter, indeed.  More than ever I wonder if I truly possess what will be required to see this tale through.  I wonder...
Ch1-84=Olon has told me that Elarath the wizard and Massus the friar are knowledgeable about the village.
Ch1-85=Olon has an interest in the underground tunnels.  Knowledge of their entrance or anything of value in their depths is information he would be willing to pay to acquire.  However, I do not believe that I shall be pursuing this matter further any time in the near future.
Ch1-86=Sir Baldulf, one of the soldiers who searched the village for Corvus, reported that they spotted signs of a "great beast" near the village Library.  As well, he told me that the Ahoul do not take prisoners, and since the soldiers did not find Corvus' body, he might still be alive.
Ch1-87=Sir Kyner informed that a battle had taken place just south of the Wizard's Tower, but he does not know the identity of the combatants.  He also warned me of voreworms in the village.
Ch1-88=Though Sir Engres was not a friend of my brother, he still volunteered to search the village for him.  All he and the other soldiers found was a group of voreworms and a smattering of tracks, both outside the village Church.  The voreworms were likely feeding on the dead, he said, and the tracks could have been either human or Ahoul.  All in all, the Church sounds to be a place deserving of a measure of caution.  I do not believe, however, that I shall be able to avoid it, as Sir Engres advised.
Ch1-89=I asked Lahren to teach me a bit about the Ahoul -- the Sha'ahoul, rather.  They are made up of different races, human, Ahoul (cousins to orcs, apparently) and a race of crossbreeds.  This would account for the variance in their appearance, and their sheer strength.  They have human mages called Sha'men fighting on their side as well.  Their warriors I may be able to vanquish, but I fear a Sha'men could easily be the death of me.  I shall have to be wary in the village.
Ch1-90=The wizard, Elazar, spoke with me a bit about Pell.  He said that Pell was an unusually powerful mage -- even more powerful than she had led me to believe -- and had the potential to be one of the "great ones".
Ch1-91=Elazar also informed me that Lahren is apparently a gifted scholar, and noted among his peers for his work on the Ahoul.
Ch1-92=I asked Elarath the wizard about Pellandrian, but though he made reference to being surprised that she was allowed out of Fornax -- perhaps hinting at a hidden connection between her and her land? -- all he would confirm is that she is a talented mage.  This, unfortunately, I had guessed previously.
Ch1-93=Mudam has warned me to be wary of a large humanoid wandering the village -- a creature that I might encounter in my search for Corvus.  This creature is most often said to be near the old village library.
tla1=General Roth says that I may find people to join me on my quest throughout the Keep.  He adds that I may only take two people with me.
tla2=I hear that Phelic's Apprentice would like to join my party to see the ruins below Avalon.
tla3=Felious may be of use to discover what kinds of creatures may thrive in the ruins.  He may be found in the basement.
tla4=General Roth has dispatched a courier to send news of Ovoron's treachery, and what it implies, to King Vortigerm.
tla5=I have to rescue Waynar and get any information he may have about the "undead creature".
tla6=I may receive advice from Felious on how to best deal with the lich.
tla7=I have helped to destroy the lich and have brought the Earthstone back to General Roth.
tla8=I have ended the threat posed by the traitorous courier.
tla9=I have been informed that Wacian possesses a very strange sense of humor.
tla10=I have encountered and dispatched a traitor requesting transfer to South Gate.
tla11=One of the "lurkers" has told me that they are, in fact, immortal as a cause of the curse.
tla12=Ither has advised me to be "more persuasive" with pen or sword to get the letter from Sir Osla.
tla13=I have brought Sir Osla's letter to Sir Ither; he seemed surprised that I was able to defeat Sir Osla.
tla14=Sir Ither attacked me after I confronted him concerning the truth of the letter Sir Osla was keeping.
tla15=Sir Osla has refused to speak to me concerning the letter Sir Ither alleges he has in his possession.
tla16=I have read Sir Osla's letter, and the truth of the matter is that Ither is the traitor mentioned in its text.
tla17=Sir Osla has expressed to me his gratitude for my help in bringing the Sir Ither debacle to a conclusion.
tla18=One of the so-called "lurkers" I've heard so little about has told me that they do not have any method of reproduction.
tla19=I've been told by Weldon that he has not seen the courier come his way.
tla20=Phelic's Apprentice has told me that Apprentice Sages do not receive a name until a "Naming ceremony."
tla21=I have been cleared by King Ryence himself of all wrongdoing considering the death of Sir Ither.  The true traitor has been brought to justice.
tla22=I have been cleared by King Ryence himself of all wrongdoing considering the death of Sir Osla.  He expresses his gratitude for assisting Sir Ither in this matter.
tla23=King Ryence expressed his gratitude to me for bringing the matter of Sir Osla's treachery to Sir Ither.
tla24=King Ryence has pardoned me for Osla's death, clearing me of wrongdoing and placing Ither under arrest.
tla25=King Ryence has had Ither placed under arrest; finally the real traitor is brought to justice.  King Ryence expresses his gratitude for handling this matter without bloodshed.
tla26=The scout's ghost has mentioned a friendship with Felious, the necromancer who lives in the basement.
tla27=The scout's ghost has told me that Waynar has survived, and is currently the prisoner of the Sha'ahoul.
tla28=Phelic has informed me that the removal of the Earthstone from the temple as much as caused it to sink below the surface.
tla29=Phelic tells me that if the Earthstone is returned to its sconce in the temple, the temple will rise again, destroying Avalon.
tla30=Phelic tells me his Apprentice will all but have earned a Name if I take him to the ruins.
tla31=I have informed Phelic of the Lurkers I've encountered, and their story.
tla32=Wacian has decided to be rude to me.  Perhaps I should let General Roth know of this.
tla33=Waynar has identified the undead menace as a lich, a creature considered to be immortal.
tla34=Waynar admits he has no idea how the lich could be defeated, but mentions that it lurks around two places; a temple shaped like an insect, and somewhere deeper within the crypt, around a different stone that he believes the lich may use in conjunction with the Earthstone.
tla35=Waynar tells me that the Sha'ahoul knew of his abilities...  Doubtless they are after the Earthstone as well.
tla36=The courier who I told to return to Roth has attacked me, and I have slain him.
tla37=I met Sir Accalon today.  Although he says he has no idea what a "retinue" is, exactly, his loyalty is defined by the hand that feeds him, and the kingdom that raised him.
tla38=Adaela, a lady who spends her time with a man named Gentza, has offered me some "squeezins."  Unfortunately, the meaning is not as I wished it to be; she was actually offering me something Gentza brewed, which is potent enough to polish a cast-iron stomach.
tla39=A soldier by the name of Beircheart bemoans that he is destined for more of a military career than that of a guard.  He seems to believe his "decision-making abilities" were noticed by the military while he was young, and that is why he enrolled.
tla40=Beircheart does not question the authority of his commanders, but he expresses the fact that Taberland sent some rather green trainees to Avalon during its period of civil unrest.
tla41=Beircheart puts stock in a rumor that General Roth is ill, because of his appearance.  I know that he has merely been busy, but he shall become ill if he does not rest.
tla42=I have heard, through Beircheart, that my recent accomplishments have occasioned comment amidst the soldiers.  They are impressed with my deeds.
tla43=It seems Beircheart does not believe the ease with which I dispatched the Lich.
tla44=I seem to have angered Cynric to the point to where he will no longer really speak to me.
tla45=I was rude to Cynric, another guard, because he was boasting of his accomplishments like some bench racer, and he did not take it well.  After calling him a blowhard, he mentioned something about having to guard an empty room somewhere.  I must be careful with this primitive in the future.
tla46=After gagging on the shameless bragging of a guard named Cynric today, he returned the favor by offering to train me in a few advanced combat techniques.  Perhaps he isn't so much of a blowhard as I initially thought.
tla47=I have awakened a soldier today who was sleeping on the job.
tla48=The sleepy soldier, who I now know of as Esmond, seems to think that his job in Avalon does not concern guarding anything or fighting anything.
tla49=Esmond has told me a tale about how he is to be Avalon's "lucky charm," after describing to me a truly lucky set of circumstances when he met his first Sha'ahoul warrior and was protected, only by luck, from being slain.
tla50=Esmond seems to believe he has "the wasting disease."  I urged him to see Brother Crosby to find out if this is truly the case.
tla51=I have been informed by Esmond that his luck has won him one poker game too many.  A man named Tracy had put up, after losing what little money he had, his father's ring in the ante.  Esmond won the ring, and I can tell he wants me to bring it back to Tracy.
tla52=I have agreed to bring Tracy's father's ring back to him, and explain that Esmond feels ashamed of the incident.
tla53=I have told Esmond to have some backbone and handle his problem with Tracy himself.  I've no doubt he'll do exactly that.
tla54=I have assisted Esmond with his problem with Tracy, and they are no longer enemies.
tla55=Cynric, the self-proclaimed accomplished warrior, seems to think that my ego needs nursing.
tla56=Esmond believes that the unprecedented destruction of a lich has earned me a spot in the annals of history.  I cannot help but agree.
tla57=A guard I spoke to today told me that the bizarre formations present in the cave structure do not allow for conversation.  Noises get garbled until they sound like something else.
tla58=I've been notified by one of the guards deep in the cave structure that a courier has passed by during the last shift.
tla59=I've been further informed that although the guards deep within the caves stay quiet, they can hear strange noises.  It's as likely as not that these are the noises of the courier passing through.  I should remain on guard.
tla60=I have been informed by one of the Elythrian knights that one of their own, Sir Dinadon, will surely be interested in joining my party if for no other reason than to see some action.  He adds that I must seek permission from Ambassador Lucius first.
tla61=I have learned that Sir Caerleon, an Elythrian, is willing to spend some time to impart some advanced combat techniques.
tla62=Dinadon's battle prowess is of some renown among his fellows.  He is well-liked and respected.
tla63=One of the "lurkers" tells me that his kind have been inhabiting the temple for hundreds of years.  I didn't have the patience to ask the poor creature whether that was before or after their hideous transformation.
tla64=I met a man named Gentza who hangs out with "the missus," whom he is also quick to point out is not his "missus," in some place he's converted into a would-be bar.  He drinks "corn squeezin's."  I have no idea.
tla65=A soldier near the cave entrance told me he hears voices.  My initial reaction is not to lend any credence to this story, but I must remember to keep both my eyes and my ears open.
tla67=I met a very nervous soldier today who said that "the tension" is wrecking his nerves.
tla68=I'm led to believe that our forces at large are either weary, and want the conflict to end, or are growing more tense with each ration reduction.
tla69=Although spirits seem low, the defenders of Avalon have not lost faith.
tla70=Some of the soldiers believe they're getting "soft."  They are eager for some military action against the Sha'ahoul.
tla71=One of the strange bipedal creatures inhabiting the temple, known as "lurkers," told me that their condition is a result of a curse placed on them by a powerful magic-user they had stolen the Earthstone from quite some time ago.
tla72=Apparently, the Lurkers worshipped a deity of beauty in their former life, before the curse twisted them.  The one I have gotten this information from says he is the smartest of those who remain, although how he...  IT can tell remains a mystery to me.
tla73=The self-proclaimed "smartest lurker" believes that if the Earthstone is replaced in its sconce, these "lurkers" will turn back into what they were before, which, by his reckoning, is human.  Furthermore, the Lurkers' goddess still speaks to this specimen, and has told it that we shall return.  If this is true, perhaps, I shall eventually find a way to aid them.
tla74=General Roth has not heard from the party he sent below Avalon in quite some time.  The members were charged with the retrieval of the Earthstone, an artifact linked to the temple located there.
tla75=Sir Roth confesses that he knows little about the Earthstone except that it poses a great threat to Avalon.  To learn more about the Earthstone, he suggests that I go see the sage Phelic.
tla76=I am to discover what happened to Roth's party, consisting of the Seer Waynar (whose purpose was to locate the Earthstone), a scout, and a knight, and rescue them if possible and if necessary.
tla77=Phelic informs me that the Earthstone was used in rituals and ceremonies by the cultists who worshiped there long ago.
tla78=A soldier named Orvyn told me today that he believes the Sha'ahoul may be simply trying to starve Avalon.  It seems obvious.
tla79=Orvyn says his psychic friend can't tell me anything about the future because it may change it for the worse.  You know, they always tell you they're "real psychics... "
tla80=Orvyn believes the beasts that the Sha'ahoul have previously employed in their attacks are simply "enslaved and mad."
tla81=At my behest, Orvyn will ask someone he refers to as his "psychic friend" how to easily defeat the Sha'ahoul.
tla82=Neese actually believes that he will be ready to spar with me soon!  I've created a monster!
tla83=Neese seems to believe that my soon-to-be biographer, Tristan, is a "worthless dreamer."  This boy may never grow up!
tla84=That boy Neese never ceases to amuse me.  Today, I told him that he should be a part of the action, to get some scars, some hair on his chest, to impress the ladies, and he looked at me stupidly.  Well, I'M certainly not going to be the one to give him the "birds and bees" lecture!
tla85=Apparently, Neese has a sensitive streak, or might I say OVERsensitive...  I think if I'm harsh enough, he'll get used to it.
tla86=That amusing child Neese has actually gotten two other soldiers, Tracy and Cynric, to show him how to fight.  May the spirits have mercy on us.  I hope the boy doesn't hurt himself.
tla87=I seem to have succeeded in my little quest to grow Neese a backbone.  He seems to have built it up a tad stronger than I'd expected.
tla88=I've met a dandy of a soldier today named Neese.  He seems to be the stereotypical "rich kid."  No responsibilities, no calluses, no pulse.  Perhaps I should try to breathe some spirit back into this corpse.
tla89=Neese's father, a successful merchant, has forced his son into the military with a threat to cut off his allowance.  This boy truly has no backbone!
tla90=There is a rumor circulating that Ovoron was seen doing battle with Mithras.  I wanted to tell the soldier just how ridiculous this claim was, but I remembered to keep my mouth shut.
tla91=I met a Fornaxan today named Wylie who, not surprisingly, was studying the mystical arts before Avalon's call reached his kingdom.
tla92=Being somewhat larger than his comrades in school, Wylie acted as their protector, and gained skill in fisticuffs and swordplay.  It was these skills that made him an ideal choice for Avalon's members.
tla93=Wylie wishes to return to his magical studies.  He believes it was what he was made for.
tla94=Wylie, and likely more of the guards and soldiers, believe that something terrible has happened, because they've picked up on General Roth's agitation as of late.
tla95=Wacian is more than just odd; I sincerely believe he has a touch of the madness to him.
tla96=I have given a guard by the name of Tristan permission to write of my deeds.
tla97=Tristan appears to have spent some semesters at some "Great Bardic College."
tla98=Tristan actually signed up to be in the military, figuring there was "GREAT" material here to write about.
tla99=I have told Tristan that I will look for a signet ring with a fox's head on it when next I am below Avalon.  He feels something has happened to the wearer, a good friend of his, and he wishes to know for sure.
tla100=I have returned Tristan's friend's ring to him.  He was not surprised to learn that his friend was dead.  As he said, he just wanted to know for sure.
tla101=I met a knight by the name of Sir Tortain today.  Unlike his namesake, he seems to be a rather impatient, sarcastic man.  Indeed, he seemed to know my intent when I approached him.  His sarcasm is refreshing, but a bit...  sharp.
tla102=I have discovered a Skeleton In Felious' Closet.  It would only scrape and tap, however.  Perhaps Felious can explain this...  Both its presence, and its refusal to speak.  I suppose if it can click and tap, it can talk.
tla103=Felious' skeleton actually thanked me for popping and clicking back at it.  It seems Felious is a rather one-sided conversationalist.
tla104=Cynric seems to share what he terms "the Fornaxan view of gossip," that it is useless, and perhaps even harmful.
tla105=Queen Nanesi has showered me with compliments and affection...  Her words.  She thinks I am an impressively modest person, as some rumors have suggested.
tla106=Queen Nanesi has showered me with compliments and affection...  Her words.  She believes me to be a very ambitious person, more so than rumor would suggest.
tla107=I have met the Queen of Oriam today, a charming woman by the name of Nanesi.  She seems impressed with my accomplishments so far and hints that if I can get His Highness to say more than a few words to me, she will speak more with me.  Her voice is rather hypnotic; I think I shall like that...
etdinadon=Sir Dinadon offered to join the party, but he said permission must be obtained from Ambassador Lucius first.
nowfesterb=Fester told me to speak to Marcus, in the Library, about an ancient medical text.
nowfesterm=Fester told me to speak to the merchant Rayous, in the Inner Bailey, about Night Faeries' Breath.
otpermission=I received permission from Ambassador Lucius to have Sir Dinadon join my party.
agecluehall=I found out from Rayous that the page, who bought Night Faeries' Breath, is often in the main hall.
agecluename=I found out from Marcus that the page, who researched a compound used on King Isdernus, is named Simek.
knowmonk=I have agreed to help discover who poisoned King Isdernus, and Brother Larry advised me to speak with Fester the Alchemist for clues.
otpoison=I found some of the compound used against King Isdernus on the body of Simek, and I will take it to Brother Larry
qcompleted=I gave the poison to Brother Larry, and he will concoct an antidote for King Isdernus.
dscout=I met a broke scout named Wyatt, and he is a potential recruit for my party.
feliousfriend=The necromancer Felious told me that the scout, from the previous expedition to the caves, was his friend.
feliousjoined=The mage Felious has joined my party, and he has spells which will help me destroy the lich.
knowofskeleton=Felious told me to speak with his skeleton to learn more of the magical art of necromancy.
nico=I encountered Captain Nicophorus today, and he has been named Ambassador of Nisos.  It was good to see a friendly face.
Kingpoisoned=I have discovered that the king of Cathea, Isdernus, has been poisoned by an unknown assailant.
metdinadon=I met someone who knows of Corvus -- an outspoken Elythrian knight by the name of Sir Dinadon.
metL=Near the quarters of King Ryence, I met Lucius, the Elythrian ambassador.  He seems quite rigid, but I suspect he is a fair man.
metodguard=Vasek, an off-duty guard from Nisos, offered to relieve me of any spare crowns I might have.  He seems a decent fellow, but has the common Nisosan dedication to wagering.
Vasekg=The guard Vasek feels little sympathy towards Wyatt, a scout from whom he won quite a few crowns.
natres=Sir Natres, of Cathea, confided in me that King Isdernus suspected several members of the court of Avalon are traitors.
lao=The Cathean knight Sir Laodegan is in quite a rage over the poisoning of King Isdernus.
laun=Sir Launfal of Cathea blames himself for letting King Isdernus be poisoned.
ch3-001=I just met Taavi, leader of a group of elves know as the Glen Guard.
ch3-002=Taavi told me that the sha'ahoul think that killing Mikki, and then taking her horn, will give the hunters good fortune for life.
ch3-003=I encountered an elf named Kalevi who seems to dislike all humans, though I've no idea why.
ch3-004=Kalevi, who once seemed to hate me, has now had a change of heart.
ch3-005=Maki, an elf and member of the glen guards, seems quite friendly and more than willing to speak of the elves and the mysteries of the forest.
ch3-006=Maki warned me of a group of lizardmen living to the west of the outpost, along the river.
ch3-007=According to Maki, an unknown force is occupying the tower on the lake's island.
ch3-008=Taavi tells me that the humans at the outpost and the elves have a bond of peace.
ch3-009=Mikki, the unicorn that the elves are protecting, has lost her mate to sha'ahoul hunters.
ch3-010=Oskari told me that the horn of slain Mikki can be crafted into a powerful weapon of justice.
ch3-011=An elf named Severi seems almost constantly distracted by the pain of the wounded forest.
ch3-012=Severi informed me that the forest will most likely heal now that the sha'ahoul have lost so many of their men.
ch3-013=Ambassador Nicophorus warned me that I may be a target for undiscovered traitors in Avalon.
ch3-014=Ambassador Nicophorus told me that Ambassador Lucius of Elythria wishes to see me.
ch3-015=Two of the Glen Guard have been slain by the sha'ahoul prior to my arrival in the forest.
ch3-016=Oskari has ordered me to go to a tower in the southeastern end of the forest and destroy all monsters there, while ingesting a pain-inducing herb.  If I complete this task, then I will have mastered the elven art of pain control.
ch3-017=I have been charged with defeating an Earth Spirit while under a suggestion that makes me feel as if I am bearing a great weight.  The spirit is located in a ring of four stones north and east of the outpost.  If I defeat him, I will learn the elven skill of fortitude.
Ch3-501=The scout Byron tells me that the elves are not "employed"  --  that instead, the alliance is one of mutual assistance.
Ch3-502=I have cleared out the Ahoul encampment and brought Byron the letter.  He has expressed displeasure in the amount of time it took me to complete this task.
ch3-503=A soldier by the name of Arno expresses incredulity at my defeat of the Lich, like it were something only a deity could do.
Ch3-504=I have met Vortigerm's advanced guard, headed by Baron Hartley, today.
Ch3-505=Baron Hartley is less than a week ahead of Vortigerm's forces.
Ch3-506=Baron Hartley is also on a quest to find King Tortain's signet ring.  He adds that I may return the ring to either him or Lord Harold.
Ch3-507=Baron Hartley was also looking for King Tortain's signet ring.  I informed him that I have returned the ring to Lord Harold.  He is pleased.
Ch3-508=Baron Hartley has requested that I aid him in finding King Tortain's signet ring, which was on him at the time of his passing.  I have offered my assistance.
Ch3-509=I have returned to Baron Hartley the signet ring of King Tortain.  He overfloweth with gratitude.
Ch3-510=King Tortain's crown has been returned to Baron Hartley.
Ch3-511=Baron Hartley mentions that I may use King Tortain's armor at least until King Vortigerm arrives.
Ch3-512=I have asked Belinda about the status of my brother.  She says that because he has taken sharp blows to the head, his recovery will be slow.
Ch3-513=The Fornaxan Dillon is irritated about the stereotypes affixed to Fornax by those in Avalon.
Ch3-514=Dillon says that the mage Pell does not follow the rules of magic, which are, as he explains, for the protection of those using magic.
Ch3-515=Dillon adds that by channeling as much magical energy as Pell does makes nightmares into reality because the conscious mind cannot handle all the magical energy, and it seeps out into the subconscious portions of the mind.
Ch3-516=Dillon advises against angering Pell, lest she unleash the amount of magic she has before.  He believes her last burst of magical energy has affected Lahren somehow.
Ch3-517=I have agreed not to release Dillon's name as the source of the information he has given me.
Ch3-518=Brother Crosby has told me that Corvus' recovery will take some time, but mentions that Corvus is in his prayers.
Ch3-519=The chambermaid Heather is mourning the loss of a loved one.  I have offered my condolences.

ch3-522=Captain Calvaric suggests that I befriend the elves.
ch3-523=Captain Calvaric says that Sirs Engres and Kyner are willing to join me on my assignments.
ch3-524=Cheney says that in his off hours he sees the Sha'ahoul bustling about south of Avalon.  From this distance, however, he is unable to ascertain what they're doing.
ch3-525=A page has approached me and told me that Captain Roth wishes to see me in the conference room, which is off the main hallway.
ch3-526=The page who approached me about Roth has told me that Calvaric could likely be found in the tavern that has been set up in the old barracks, located in the Inner Bailey.
ch3-527=Elazar's vision places an Ahoul in the ruined village who is wearing Tortain's armor and signet.  He says he feels the man has been sent to occupy the village.
ch3-528=Lord Harold, one of the only remaining Taberlanders, has requested my aid in returning to him the signet ring of the fallen King Tortain.  I have assured him that I will do what is in my power to assist him.
ch3-529=Lord Harold is also concerned about the location of King Tortain's ring.  He says I may return it to either he or Baron Hartley, whichever is most convenient for me.
ch3-530=Lord Harold is also concerned about the location of King Tortain's ring.  I have told him that I returned the ring to Baron Hartley, and he has expressed his gratitude for my assistance.
ch3-531=I have returned King Tortain's signet ring to Lord Harold.  He has expressed his gratitude for my assistance.
ch3-532=Halwin has told me that he sees the Sha'ahoul bustling with activity in camps south of Avalon.
ch3-533=Huon advises me to be careful around Olon.  He says he doesn't like the look in the man's eyes.
ch3-534=Holly has heard word that the presence of the beetles in the storage basement was the work of our enemy.  She does not place much faith in this rumor, however.
ch3-535=Captain Holden says that the elves "tag" those who are to be allowed in the camp with a red flag to let the others know to allow them through.
ch3-536=Captain Holden informs me that there is an alliance between the elves and the humans in the camp, although it is a bit "wobbly."
ch3-537=I must clear out a small encampment of Sha'ahoul so that the scout Byron may exit the forest with Sir Roth's missive.
ch3-538=There are some "lizard-men" in the forest, according to Captain Holden.
ch3-539=I am now to take Sir Roth's letter to the scout Byron.
ch3-540=I have retrieved Captain Holden's status report.
ch3-541=Captain Holden knows little of the so-called "lizard-men" save that they are carnivorous, and take prisoners.
ch3-542=Sir Mabon has requested that I retrieve status reports from the following people:
ch3-543=-Captain Holden, in the hidden outpost;
ch3-544=-Captain Penrith, in the outer bailey;
ch3-545=-Commander Calum, in South Gate, and
ch3-546=-Lord Harold, in the Outer Keep.
ch3-547=I have told Sir Mabon that I will do what I can to assist him with the status reports.
ch3-548=Sir Mabon, successor to General Ovoron as Field Marshall, has found the Field Marshall's office in disarray.
ch3-549=I have returned all the status reports to Sir Mabon.  He thanks me for my assistance.
ch3-550=The sage Phelic is cautious about performing experiments on the Earthstone for fear what the ancient magics might do.
ch3-551=Phelic adds that the Earthstone may have a "magical booby-trap" on it, and has decided to be very cautious about what he does with and to it.
ch3-552=I have retrieved Penrith's status report.
ch3-553=Today I have met Padwer, the Chancellor.  His duties are to keep the nobles from being at odds with each other.

ch3-555=The scout Morton has told me that he finds no better life than that of the soldier.

ch3-557=Newman expresses distaste of Baron Hartley's supercilious "noble" attitude.
ch3-558=The soldier Tomik warns me to be cautious outside of Avalon.  He says he knows the Ahoul are up to something.
ch3-559=The armorer Tempest has expressed his distaste that he no longer does any "real" work, but instead refits armor for knights who have "gone soft."
ch3-560=The weaponsmith Tempest has agreed to draft Mikki's horn into a powerful weapon for me.  He says this is the masterpiece he's been waiting for.
ch3-561=I have met the Minister of the Interior today, a pleasant man by the name of Tavous.  His duty is to look out for the welfare of the common man.
ch3-562=Tavous says that the plague in the Peasant's Bailey must be quarantined until it can be dealt with properly, else we all stand to lose.
ch3-563=The soldier Soren has been terribly misinformed by his mother about elves.  She has told him that they have pointy teeth, forked tongues, and horns.  I have disavowed him of this ridiculous notion.
ch3-564=I have met an escaped slave in an underground tunnel.  He says that he and several others were captured by the lizard-men for food.  He managed to escape, and he beseeches me to rescue the only remaining two.
ch3-565=I have met an escaped slave in an underground tunnel.  He told me his tale of capture by the lizard-men and beseeched me to help his friends.  I have, however, already freed them, and told him as much.
ch3-566=Rayburn, one of the scouts in Baron Hartley's entourage, has said he does not like Hartley's "thee" and "thou" language.  He finds it supercilious, and has gone as far as to suggest that they are trying to employ mind control on those who do not speak in such a manner.
ch3-567=Rayburn has confessed to me, after some questioning, that he was forced into military service to avoid being jailed for stealing.
ch3-568=The slave I met in the tunnel thanks me profusely for freeing his friends, and regrets that he only has the "gratitude of a broken man" to offer me, which I have, of course, accepted.
ch3-569=I have met a knight by the name of Sir Fagen who is very interested in what I do.  He wishes to tell his friends the truth about what I've done, rather than listen to the rumors.
ch3-570=Sir Fagen is a VERY curious person.
ch3-571=Sir Fagen is acting very strange.  He seems to be nervous about something, but he is unwilling to discuss it further.
ch3-572=Sherard, the wizard's assistant, seems overconfident that he will become a great and powerful mage.
ch3-573=Sir Roth advises caution; rumors and accusations have sprung up about he and I being traitors.
ch3-574=Sir Roth mentions that if he is ever unavailable, that I may report to his personal page, Entrowe; he can be trusted and will act as a messenger for when Sir Roth is busy.
ch3-575=I must get a key from Captain Calvaric to get out of the caves, which lead to the forest.
ch3-576=The lock on the gate to the caves is of an advanced design, and can be set to refuse a key that has been used in it once.
ch3-577=Sir Roth expects there to be Sha'ahoul in the forest, as Ovoron knew of the outpost's general location.
ch3-578=Sir Roth informs me that Elazar has had a vision of King Tortain's armor.  His help may be necessary in order to find the armor.
ch3-579=Sir Roth reminds me that he urgently needs the courier's letter back.
ch3-580=Lord Harold tells me that Elazar has some information about King Tortain's armor.
ch3-581=Sir Roth mentions that there is a hidden outpost located in the forest to the north.
ch3-582=I have retrieved Lord Harold's status report.
ch3-583=I have heard that a group of riders -- non-Ahoul, to be sure -- were seen entering the forest from the north.
ch3-584=Entrowe tells me that Ambassador Lucius has been looking for me.
ch3-585=Sir Roth has had Entrowe send me a message; the outpost is in need of help!  A force of Sha'ahoul have arrived and are threatening the exposure of the outpost or worse!
ch3-586=I encountered and dispatched a Sha'ahoul general in the village today.  He was wearing King Tortain's armor and signet ring.
ch3-587=I have found the man of Elazar's dreams, the Sha'ahoul warrior wearing King Tortain's armor and signet ring.  His style was weak, and after I showed him what was up, he begged to lick the soles of my boots.
ch4-001=I met Ambassador Johfrit of Aratoy.  He is seeking help in rescuing a member of his entourage named Edgard, who was taken in an ambush by the sha'ahoul outside Avalon's walls.
ch4-002=It turns out that Edgard, the captive Aratoyan, is the nephew of Ambassador Johfrit and only son of one of the most powerful of the land's clanmothers.
ch4-003=Sir Evadam, the sole surviving knight in Ambassador Johfrit's entourage, is too injured to attempt a rescue of Edgard of Aratoy.
ch4-004=The Scoutmaster has offered to train me.
ch4-005=The Scoutmaster has decided to test me by having me retrieve an article of clothing from the Houndmaster's tent without alerting the dogs there.  The Houndmaster's tent is located near a collapsed corner-tower portion of the village wall, to the south of the Scoutmaster's tent.
ch4-006=I have been commanded by the Scoutmaster to slay a group of treacherous Lizardmen before he will train me further.  They make their camp in an abandoned farmhouse, located between the Scoutmaster's and Mithras' tent on the eastern edge of the war camp.
ch4-007=I have been charged with recovering a set of tactical maps, which were last seen in the hands of a mortally wounded scout in the village.  Upon completion, the Scoutmaster will further my training.
ch4-008=The Scoutmaster has reveal his secret to me. He is actually an Orian whose mother was captured while she carried him.  He has been working to undermine the war effort of the sha'ahoul for some time.
ch4-009=Fester has generously given me a rare oil, one which will cause anointed weapons to ignite anything flammable that they strike. [To use, equip in misc. slot.  Equipped weapon will then inflict fire damage.]
ch4-010=When I have more experience[training points], the Scoutmaster will teach me the skill of Camouflage.
ch4-011=The Scoutmaster suggested that the shirt I retrieved from the Houndmaster may help disguise my scent from the camp's dogs.
ch4-100=I have met an unusual old scout, Old Ben, in the abandoned village.
ch4-101=Old Ben has created a copy of Mithras' staff which he hopes to switch with the real one.
ch4-102=I have agreed to switch the fake staff of Old Ben's for the true staff, which is located in Mithras' tent.
ch4-500=Entrowe has mentioned to me that Ambassador Johfrit has been looking for me.  He has requested that I check up on the Ambassador.
ch4-501=Entrowe has warned me about the existence of trained Sha'ahoul dogs, whose senses are apparently so keen that some think they are imbued with magical abilities.
ch4-502=Pell says she has enchanted Olon's magical mask with the ability to translate incoming and outgoing Sha'ahoul.  She also adds that the enchantment will make my appearance different to everyone who beholds me.
ch4-503=I have heard that Olon takes matters of debt and honor very seriously.
ch4-504=Mudam says that in addition to the Sha'ahoul, rumors say there are non-humans a short distance from Avalon's walls.  He adds that he believes that Sha'man magic is at work concealing our view of their activities.
ch4-505=Olon possesses a magical mask capable of making me look like a Sha'ahoul warrior!  I must have this mask if I am to scout the Sha'ahoul-occupied areas.
ch4-506=I am to find a way to communicate to the Sha'ahoul warriors to discover when they plan to launch their attack.
ch4-507=Mudam tells me that General Roth has an assignment for me, one that might be performed in the same areas Mudam has ordered me to scout.
ch4-508=The snake-men I encountered are known as the Naga.  Mudam expresses surprise not at their existence, but at their proximity to settled areas.  He requests that I report their existence to Captain Calvaric when I've the chance.
ch4-509=I am told that I may be able to procure an oil from an alchemist that will aid me in burning the Sha'ahoul war machine.
ch4-510=I am to report the Sha'man meeting to Captain Calvaric.
ch4-511=Olon urges me to return the wand as I have agreed, saying that it would be "easier on both of us that way."  I believe he is implying something entirely different.
ch4-512=Olon says that I may pick up his mask from Pell; she has been adding an enchantment to it at his request.
ch4-513=I am told that Olon always pays back his favors.
ch4-514=Calvaric tells me not to bother with the Sha'ahoul commanders' meeting; he says the destruction of their battering ram will disturb them sufficiently.
ch4-515=General Roth believes that Ovoron's satchel holds "insurance" -- some documents from Avalon that Mithras has not been informed of.
ch4-516=Ovoron's tent was taken on his expedition, and he is likely using it even now.  It will be easy to spot amidst all the Sha'ahoul-built tents.
ch4-517=The Naga are known to be intelligent, though the depth of that intelligence is not yet known.  Their origins are unclear, but some believe they were created by a magic-user.
ch4-518=Elazar has had a vision of Avalon's destruction.  In it, a giant battering ram, fashioned to look like some large bird, aids in Avalon's fall.
ch4-519=Elazar's vision contains a hopeful vision of a hero, who can prevent the invasion and in whose honor a statue will be crafted in his likeness.
ch4-520=Mithras' presence is growing stronger, says Elazar.  It is disturbing his sleep, and he believes that Mithras is more than a mere warrior.
ch4-521=I inquired as to Corvus' whereabouts today, and Mudam said that my brother insisted to be put back on duty and has been busy with assignments since then.
ch4-522=I came back to report partial completion of my scouting assignment to Mudam today, but he turned me away, saying he needs all three areas scouted before he can make any more decisions.
ch4-523=Mudam wishes for me to speak to the Sha'ahoul warriors to discover the time of their attack.  The mask's new enchantment should aid me in that respect.
ch4-524=Mudam thanks me for completing his tasks in a timely manner.  He believes that my success in the field will give the Sha'ahoul enough pause for Vortigerm's forces to arrive, but I get the feeling he believes it is all that can be done -- that it's in Fate's hands, now...
ch4-525=Mudam believes my successes in the field will give the Sha'ahoul enough pause for Vortigerm's forces to arrive.
ch4-526=After learning that the battering ram in his vision had been destroyed, Elazar told me that I must be the hero who was portrayed in his vision, the one whose accomplishments are heralded with the construction of a statue...
ch4-527=Captain Calvaric has expressed his eagerness to have Vortigerm's military heads review his battle plans.  I have assured him that I will do all in my power to ensure that it shall happen.
ch4-528=Mudam has hinted at a past friendship with Olon that may have taken some strain when the two men went their separate professional paths.  However, they are still "on good terms," although Mudam would rather this fact remain secret.
ch4-529=Olon may require a service of me before allowing me to use his mask; Mudam informs me that he is a man of honor, and does not believe in being indebted.
ch4-530=Although Mudam seemed to show some displeasure at my acting without orders in destroying the ram, he accepted my explanation readily enough, probably since he would have ordered me to do as much.
ch4-531=Pell has finished enchanting Olon's mask; now I will be able to speak to the Sha'ahoul if the need should arise.
ch4-532=I have discovered that Entrowe is actually a Sha'man in disguise.  Should I destroy him now, or warn Sir Roth first?
ch4-533=Pell tells me that Olon takes debts, and apparently the payment thereof, very seriously.
ch4-534=I have returned Ovoron's satchel to Sir Roth, and, as he believed, Ovoron had kept a few documents from his new ally, Mithras.  One wonders how long Ovoron will last without this bargaining chip...
ch4-535=Entrowe apparently will seek a future in the military.  He said, with a dream in his eyes, that someday he will be making great and powerful decisions.
ch4-536=Mudam does not know much more about the non-humans to the east, but a trusted scout brought him information of strange noises and shadows.  The area does not seem to be affected by the perhaps-magical darkness that afflicts the Sha'ahoul occupied territories.
ch4-537=Mudam also wishes me to keep an eye open for a scout he sent to map the Sha'ahoul encampment.  He sent the scout to make maps of the Sha'ahoul encampments, and says that these maps will be of use to me on my mission.
ch4-538=Mudam warns me to avoid the elite guards I may encounter in the camp, for they have killed every Avalonian who has ever faced them.
ch4-539=I have discovered that the Sha'ahoul are indeed constructing a stout framework of logs.  Although it may be too early to tell, it resembles a large battering ram.
ch4-540=The reports of non-humans were true!  Some grotesque unity of man and snake, they have the upper torso of a man, but "stand" on their tails...  From their placement, they must surely be allies of the Sha'ahoul!
ch4-541=I have discovered a group of Sha'ahoul running training drills in the southern location.  Surely they must be limbering up for an invasion!
ch4-542=Mudam suggests that I should perform these missions alone; there is, after all, only one mask, and if but one of my party members is spotted...
ch4-543=Mudam has added that General Ovoron is a master of siege warfare, and he fears the construction is at his behest.  It is likely that they are building a siege machine.
ch4-544=I have seen Ovoron the traitor!  Although it would be in Avalon's best interest to dispatch him immediately, he has some potent-looking Sha'men with him.  Perhaps I will be able to reach him later...
ch4-545=I have found a shirt that belongs to the Sha'ahoul Houndmaster.
ch4-546=Olon says that the mask's enchantment will not affect true humans (Avalonians), animals, and the more intelligent Sha'ahoul.
ch4-300=The Sha'ahoul craftsmen seem to be involved in a major project -- some sort of war machine? -- to further their war effort.  It seems likely that the next Sha'ahoul assault on Avalon will not take place until this project is completed.
ch4-301=I spoke with a young Sha'ahoul called Shallen today and left him in a muddle after only a few words.  He reminds me of any of a number of boys back home, and would likely fit in easily if circumstances were different.  This is not something I had expected of a Sha'ahoul and so I am left to wonder: which of us ended more disturbed by our conversation?
ch4-302=Talshven is the name of a warrior I fought today.  At first I thought my deception revealed to the camp, but he was just testing my worthiness as a Sha'ahoul in a trial by combat.
ch4-305="Va" seems to be the honorific used when addressing a warrior, something I should keep in mind lest I risk discovery.
ch4-306="Ha" is the hunter's honorific.  I will remember it.
ch4-307="Ta" is the honorific by which craftsmen are called.  In my guise as a warrior I outrank simple craftsmen, so using the honorific is not strictly necessary but leaving it off may antagonize them.
ch5-001=The spirit of Felious saw the Naga and Dreamwalkers bind a powerful spirit in the temple on the Astral Plane.
ch5-002=Felious's spirit witnessed the Sha'men Dreamwalkers lead a ghostly woman -- who appeared to be from Avalon -- into the inner chambers of the Astral Temple.
ch5-003=Felious's spirit suspects that the being he saw the Dreamwalkers and Naga defeat was some sort of guardian; a being who defended the neutrality of the plane.
ch5-004=I have been directed to seek the ancient spirit known as the Muir, which should hold the answers to the sha'ahoul's tampering in the Astral Plane.
ch5-005=To reach the Muir, I must first retrieve a medallion -- the Reif Medallion -- from Felious's former quarters.
ch5-006=Felious's Spirit has observed that the Naga seem unable to cast normal spells.
ch5-007=In my search to understand the current affliction of our queen, Felious's spirit has directed me to a text -- known as the Morbidicon Confinimus -- which Elarath should have in his possession.
ch5-008=The spirit of Felious told me to inform Elarath of my successful efforts to free said spirit from the Astral Plane.
ch5-009=I have promised Felious's spirit that I would give his skeletal assistant new orders.
ch5-010=Lahren seems rather concerned about an unknown force that seems to be assaulting Pell when she sleeps.
ch5-011=Lahren knows that a magistrate from Fornax has come to Avalon, but there is little he can do about it.
ch5-012=Lahren asked me not to tell Pell about the Fornaxan Magistrate.
ch5-013=Sherard has advanced in his studies, and he even believes he can teach me some spells.  I imagine these spell are of the most basic sort, much like those I first learned from Elarath.
ch5-014=According to the Muir, the spells that bind the Astral Guardian are being powered by a Sha'ahoul ritual on the fiery world of Infernus.
ch5-015=The portal to Infernus is located to the north of the Frosthelm portal, just east of the Astral Temple.
ch5-016=The Muir has provided me with a medallion that will open the portal to Infernus.
ch5-017=I have been warned that non-natives traveling through Infernus usually need enchantments to protect them from the heat.
ch5-018=Glaucus says that the Muir is located in a cave in the western end of the valley where he makes his home.
ch5-019=The mage Glaucus has urged me to continue my journey to the Muir, so that I might find a way to free the Astral Guardian -- who will likely aid me against the Sha'ahoul and Naga.
ch5-020=Phelic says he has some important business to discuss with me.
ch5-021=Phelic seems pleased with my plan to turn the Earthstone over to Aenea, the Astral Guardian.
ch5-022=Phelic has given me the Earthstone.
ch5-023=Phelic's apprentice now has a name -- Icharas.  He has been encouraged to remain with me for as long as he wishes.
ch5-024=The Astral Guardian's Necklace, which she needs in order to help me in my quest, has been taken by the Naga to Notsuoh.  The portal to Notsuoh is located to the northeast of the Astral Temple, near the portal to Infernus.  To enter the portal, I must have one of the tokens that all Naga carry.
ch5-025=The Astral Guardian requires the Earthstone and her necklace so that she can open a portal to the Sha'men camp in Avalon.  The Earthstone should still be with Phelic the Sage, in Avalon.
ch5-026=The Astral Guardian recommends that I return the Queen's heart jar to Avalon, where someone should be able to deal with it.
ch5-027=The Astral Guardian feels confident that she can restore the lurkers on the Astral Plane.
ch5-028=With the aid of the former lurkers, the Astral Guardian has promised to defend against further attacks from the Sha'ahoul and Naga.
ch5-029=The Sha'men, who I saw escape with Queen Nanesi's spirit, have fled to their hidden camp in Avalon.  Aenea says she can open a portal there, so that I may complete this most strange and educational mission.
ch5-030=Now that she has the items she needs, the Astral Guardian can open a portal to the Sha'men camp.
ch5-031=The lurkers were once apparently the favored people of the Astral Guardian, but a terrible disaster cursed them, as well as separating them from her aid.
ch5-032=The Sha'ahoul are using the inner chambers of the Astral Plane to more effectively manipulate the spirits of Avalonians, since the place has a lingering connection to our world.
ch5-033=Once I travel through the portal to the Sha'men camp, Aenea plans to begin her efforts to restore the lurkers.
ch5-040=To free Queen Nanesi's spirit, I must get an item, known as a heart jar, from the Sha'men in their secret camp.
ch5-045=I just saw a Dreamwalker disappear with what appeared to be the spirit of Queen Nanesi.  Perhaps the Astral Guardian can explain this.
ch5-47=Elarath has asked me to find out if something unusual has happened to the recently deceased necromancer Felious.  He hinted that this might be a chance to elevate my standing among other mages of our realms.
ch5-050=Sherard saw a pair of mages, newly arrived from Fornax, in the Inner Bailey.  Perhaps I should pay them a visit, in case they might be willing to share some of their arcane wisdom.
ch5-500=I have spoken with Belinda in the infirmary; Elazar is there, as expected, but Belinda is unsure what ails him.  She requests that I leave him be  --  I suppose I have no choice.
ch5-501=Calum has informed me that Elazar has taken ill and has been moved to the infirmary.  I suppose I shall have to bring his ring to Elarath, now.
ch5-502=Elarath has not the time to teach me any more spells, but assures me that his assistant, Sherard, has the time and the ability to do so.
ch5-503=Elarath wishes for me to see Elazar; the two are working on an ancient portal discovered in the ruins beneath Avalon, and Elazar needs my help... with something.
ch5-504=The only advice Elarath can give me regarding Elazar's defense on his tower is that he doubts that it can last forever.
ch5-505=Sherard has informed Elarath that Elazar has taken ill.  He is likely in the infirmary.
ch5-506=I have relinquished the Ring of Form Protection to Elarath, whereupon he was reminded to mention that Pell has been looking for me.
ch5-507=Elarath believes that the portal will take me to the Astral Plane, but to a point that was fixed in an era lost in time.
ch5-508=Elarath has told me a very important piece of news.  While magic will work normally on the Astral Plane, ordinary weapons will not do any damage.  Only enchanted weapons will be effective on the Astral Plane.
ch5-509=Elarath has said that he will stand watch over the portal to ensure that we do not receive any unwanted visitors.
ch5-510=Elarath is unfamiliar with the enchantment on the Heart Jar; while the Sha'men have discovered many of the same magics we use, they have done it through different means.
ch5-511=Elarath is unsure what shall happen to Queen Nanesi if the Heart Jar is destroyed.
ch5-512=Elarath has told me that divination was one of Pell's major studies.
ch5-513=Elazar advises against speaking to the Queen again.  Since the Sha'men were pretending to be her protectors, and since I have defeated them, it is likely that a portion of her believes me to be the enemy.
ch5-514=Elarath has promoted me from Apprentice to Mage!  I have received a staff to commemorate this occasion.
ch5-515=Elarath has begun the study of the passage of the Morbidicon dealing with the Heart Jar.  I should return to check on his progress soon.
ch5-516=Queen Nanesi's soul has been released, and has returned to her body.  Elarath advises me to be discreet in my dealings with the Queen as she is likely very shaken by the process.
ch5-517=Elarath has been trying to find a way to use an ancient portal, found in the ruins beneath Avalon, as a more effective escape route than that afforded by the caves.
ch5-518=The first attempts to use the portal Elarath has been working on have transported objects passed through it to an unknown location, likely where the portal led when it was created ages ago.
ch5-519=Elazar attempted to employ courtesy to me today -- and actually admitted as much.  What is this world coming to?
ch5-520=Currently, while Elarath can control where the portal leads, it ruins everything passed through it.  Elazar believes that Elarath can transfer the enchantment from a Ring of "Form Protection" to the portal to make it work correctly.
ch5-521=Elazar owns such a "form protection" ring, and it is located in his chambers on the third floor of his tower.
ch5-522=Elazar tells me to greet his "big book" when he arrives, and to... tell it... to reference entries 491 and 673 from his log.  I do hope our Seer is feeling well; it would be unfortunate for him to end up like poor Waynar.
ch5-523=I have met a Magistrate of Fornax named Khaele, who wishes for me to pass a message on to a mage whom the Council has been unable to reach.
ch5-524=Khaele claims to have no interest in the conflict between the Council and the mage he seeks; he says his only interest, and only task, is "persuading the accused to come to trial."
ch5-525=Khaele assures me that he will do everything in his power to see that his ends are met without bloodshed.  He bemoans the fact that offensive spells are what he is best at.
ch5-526=Although Khaele has no interest in Pell, whom he has identified as the mage he seeks, he refers to her as childish -- probably for ignoring the summons of the Council.
ch5-527=I have agreed to tell Lahren that Khaele seeks Pell.  He will decide when to worry Pell with this information.  Khaele also says that his apprentice will accompany me if I wish.
ch5-528=Now that I have passed the message to Lahren, Khaele says that the "waiting game" has begun...
ch5-529=Khaele has taught me the spell "Mirror Image" for passing his message.  His confidence in my ability to reason what it does is flattering.
ch5-530=Queen Nanesi is now so irritated with me that she refuses to speak with me.  I should leave her be.
ch5-531=Queen Nanesi does not seem to be doing well.  She is clearly very agitated.
ch5-532=Elazar's talking tome has directed me towards a book that will upgrade my flame spell so long as I am holding it.
ch5-533=Elazar's book has a name...  Er, a title, and it is "Librius."
ch5-534=Pell is feeling apprehensive as of late.  She does not know if it is due to troubling dreams, for she usually remembers them.
ch5-535=Pell believes the Sha'ahoul may have something to do with her apprehensiveness, and has decided to ask a few of the other inhabitants of Avalon about their bad dreams.
ch5-536=With the aid of divination magics, Pell has discovered what has been worrying herself and the others.  The Sha'men are manipulating the spirits of Avalonians somewhere on...  "the Astral Plane."
ch5-537=Astral Planes are worlds, some just like our own, says Pell.  The Sha'men are inhabiting an area known as the Astral Nexus, which is apparently conducive to their manipulation of our kinsmen because it shares properties with each of the worlds it connects to.
ch5-538=The Sha'men have been employing a process known as "astral projection" to appear on the Astral Plane.  These Sha'men may be the "dreamwalkers" I've heard reference to.
ch5-539=The portal that Elarath has been working on is my best opportunity to reach the Astral Plane, since it is believed that the Astral Nexus was its original destination.
ch5-540=Bones has requested that I find out from Felious' spirit what Bones is to do with himself now that Felious has passed on.
ch5-541=Felious' assistant, Bones, has been prowling the halls of Avalon, dressed in his former master's clothing!
ch5-542=I have delivered Felious' message to his skeleton, who apparently relishes the chance to be productive.
ch5-543=Bones has found a way to free Felious from his spiritual imprisonment.  The incantation he found will force the lich into a body again.  In this state, without a stone to protect it, it can finally be defeated and Felious freed to join the realm of the dead.
ch5-546=Elarath has told me that a Fornaxan Magistrate has arrived and is currently in the Inner Bailey.  Elarath believes his presence here means that he, or the council, wants something...
ch5-544=Elarath has told me to report to him from now on, since Elazar has taken ill.
ch5-545=Elazar tells me that to enter his tower, I need only touch a branch on the tree immediately outside of it.  Which branch it is, I do not know, but Elazar is confident that I will find it without problem.
ch5-547=Elarath believes that one of the blacksmiths -- I believe he meant to say either Tempest or Lucan -- has an enchanted sword that I may use on the Astral Plane.
ch6-001=The Warden of the Gates, Calum, has the keys to the various gatehouses.  He was last seen in South Gate.
ch6-002=Cirrico, commander of the Blood Roses, assures me that her troops can hold East Gate now.
ch6-003=Mara, the wounded Blood Rose, is recovering from her injuries.
ch6-004=Anora says Bonnie is going to South Gate.
ch6-005=Anora's assistant Bonnie was eaten by beetles in the kitchen's basement.
ch6-006=According to Anora, Bonnie was in South Gate when the Sha'ahoul took it.
ch6-007=Bonnie is to deliver supplies to South Gate.
ch6-008=Having been rescued from the Sha'ahoul by me, Bonnie will hide in the village until hostilities die down.
ch6-009=The Peasant's Bailey Gatehouse can be reached via a catwalk on the third floor of the Outer Keep.
ch6-010=According to Captain Calvaric, a skeletal army holds the lower caverns against all intruders.
ch6-011=Captain Avarous is commandeering most men that pass through the third floor of the Outer Keep.  (All party members are taken.)
ch6-012=If Captain Avarous took any of your party members, you may now get them back.
ch6-013=Corvus will join my party now.
ch6-014=Elarath may be able to help with the mystery of Elazar's illness.
ch6-015=The Sha'ahoul Scoutmaster has defected from Mithras' camp, but not before sowing much chaos.
ch6-301=Tristan is apparently busy working on an epic.
ch6-302=Gentza is working on a new drink, and is very excited about it.
ch6-303=Orvyn's friend has been receiving visions of dead knights arisen.
ch6-304=The sages are extremely busy due to new documents from Fornax.
ch6-305=Anthamas Shadomar, a Fornaxan Mage, has been charged with helping to augment our military magically.
ch6-306=Anthamas believes Kahl Rothog may be dwelling in the caverns below Avalon.  He suggests that I use my wits against him, as nothing else will prevail.
ch6-307=Zinestra informs me that sirs Saffire, Hoal, Beneyce, and Tortain love to chat about childhood legends and stories together, and she feels sir Saffire is the most knowledgeable of them.
ch6-308=Beirchart feels the sages would know more about the land under Avalon.
ch6-309=Sir Caerleon feels a true knight's strength lies in his faith and humility.
ch6-310=Poor Chad really wishes he was young again.
ch6-311=Jora is very upset with someone trampling the flowerbeds. I think she's talking about me...
ch6-312=Callie thinks I should talk with Zoe about sir Tortain.
ch6-313=Gentza and Opias are working together on a potion.
ch6-314=I discovered a hungry cannibal, Krog, in the caverns below Avalon.
ch6-315=I have defeated the cannibal, Krog, in a test of wits. He is probably all that remains of Kahl Rothog.
ch6-316=Madelaine implies that Estrella, Zoe, or Allison would be good to ask about gossip on the knights in Avalon.
ch6-317=Merchant George advises me to talk to Marcus in the Inner Keep.
ch6-318=One of the new Fornax Mages is named Anthamas Shadomar, and he is a friend of Opias.
ch6-319=Merchant George believes Anthamas is working on a protective fire-resistant garment.
ch6-320=Opias' friend, Anthamas Shadomar, has set up shop in a laboratory on the second level of the Inner Keep.
ch6-321=Fenton is researching information on an ancient thieves' guild.
ch6-322=Percy is researching poisons for his king, Ryence.
ch6-323=Gronk is researching the land Avalon was built upon.
ch6-324=Mudam has been sent upon a secret mission, one he is likely to not return from.
ch6-325=Mudam mentioned one of the guards in the Outer Keep Mess Hall might be holding something for one of the Fornaxan Mages.
ch6-326=Orvyn's friend has been having intense dreams and visions that indicate a history buried under Avalon that begs to return.
ch6-327=There is a prophecy that the descendant of sir Belarm, the first holy knight, will return to the land to restore that which has been forgotten.
ch6-328=Sir Saffire believes that a true knight's strength flows from his heart.
ch6-329=The city Avalon was built on was once a thriving metropolis protected by an order of invincible holy knights.  Since then, however, the city has fallen to a terrible curse.
ch6-330=Sage Opias and his friend, Anthamas Shadomar, are working on reinforcing Avalon's militia through magical means.
ch6-331=Fenton believes Mudam is headed on a mission he will not return from.
ch6-332=The amulet Mudam gave me radiates combined magic, but the Sage Fenton believes it is really a key to a hidden doorway.
ch6-333=The sages are finally able to translate some texts about the land below Avalon, thanks to the arrival one of the Fornaxan mages.
ch6-335=Sir Tortain has suffered a terrible loss at the hands of the Sha'ahoul; his family was taken right before his eyes.
ch6-340=Estrella suggests that if I want to know more about old knightly legends, I should consult Sirs Saffire, Tortain, Caerleon, or even Beirchart.
ch6-341=Opias has requested that I check on Gentza.
ch6-345=Zoe mentioned that Sir Tortain carries a horrible secret about his past that he looks ready to reveal, and that Estrella might have more gossip on the knights of Avalon.
ch6-350=Allison indicated that Sirs Caerleon and Tortain talk often about childhood legends nearly as much as the sages  busy themselves with their research as of late.
ch6-360=I have encountered a spirit inhabiting a set of ancient armor in a temple in the caverns below Avalon.
ch6-361=Anthamas has requested that I check on the sage Opias and assist him if I can.
ch6-500=Entrowe has told me that Sir Roth requests my presence.
ch6-501=Entrowe became enraged when I told him of Sir Roth's death, which I had to swear to avenge before he would calm down.
ch6-502=After telling Sir Roth that the skeletons beneath Avalon are the work of Felious' assistant, he informed me that Wacian mentioned that these skeletons will attack anything except each other.
ch6-503=After I wondered aloud if the lich were responsible for the skeletons beneath Avalon, Sir Roth mentioned that he has heard of some spells that delay before taking effect.
ch6-504=Sir Roth has told me that he may leave before I return because he must check on the fortifications at East Gate.
ch6-505=Tempest is forging a proper sword for Sir Roth, possibly with the fine steel that I discovered and brought back what seems like ages ago.
ch6-506=Wacian requires that I obtain permission before going back down in the caves.  He is certain I'll be "mobbed."
ch6-507=Wacian has confirmed that the skeletons will attack anything except themselves; he witnessed one attacking a rat.
ch6-508=I have been urged to consult Phelic concerning the undead plague.  Wacian has told me that Phelic mentioned something about spots of concentrated evil, and he thinks that such a condition has caused the problem with the skeletons.
ch6-509=Phelic has pointed me towards Friar Massus, who, as a man of the cloth, has knowledge of things both holy and unholy, and how to thwart the undead.
ch6-510=Phelic requests that I keep my senses keen for a new apprentice for him, someone who would like to learn quite a bit.
ch6-511=I have been thanked deeply by Phelic for my discovery of a curious man who will likely become his next apprentice.  Phelic is surprised to learn that he can already read.
ch6-512=A replacement for Phelic's apprentice has been found among the captives of the "Lizardmen," a man who shares Phelic's thirst for knowledge and -- amazingly -- already knows how to read.
ch6-513=I shall have to check on Friar Massus later for a possible solution to the skeletons beneath Avalon.
ch6-514=Friar Massus has suggested finding the nexus of the lich's remaining evil and pouring holy water from the Chalice of Life on it.  He believes this will remove the taint that has infected the area.
ch6-515=Bones suggests that I speak with Phelic on how to solve the undead problem.
ch6-516=Bones believes that the "sinkhole of evil" is the lich's altar.
ch6-517=Sherard has been slain by Queen Nanesi's henchmen for attempting to, by reflex, cast a defensive spell.  It was mistaken as an attack.
ch6-518=The Queen seems to be suffering from complete amnesia since immediately after the attack.
ch6-519=Calum believes that the inhabitants of Avalon are finally beginning to feel the effects of the siege...
ch6-520=Calum's gate keys are hidden in his quarters in South Gate Level 3.  They are buried in a potted plant.
ch6-521=I found Holt in the basement beneath South Gate.  According to him, South Gate was taken so quickly that he barely escaped below with his life.
ch6-522=The enchantment of weapons is a relatively simple process; it requires only a bit of magic to bond oils to metal.  The skill must lie in the making of the potions.
ch6-523=Upon informing Tempest of the terrible news of Roth's defeat, the adamant blacksmith has practically thrust Roth's sword at me.  To leave such a sword unused would be a waste, he says.
ch6-524=I found a man beneath Avalon who would get along well with Phelic.  I told him as much, and he jumped at the chance to meet Avalon's sage.
ch6-525=Incredibly, I have stood trial for treason with Elarath and Corvus!  The whole fiasco was going well for me, as there was no evidence, but Queen Nanesi, our accuser, insisted upon using theatrics and drawing the trial out.  However, a panting page interrupted the proceedings, screaming that South Gate had been taken!
ch6-526=Brave Sir Phelot, who had been attacked by traitors from the 3rd floor of South Gate, gasped to me through clenched teeth a plea to lower the gate.  Tragically, by the time I had lowered the gate completely, he had expired...
ch6-527=Fester has confided in me that he has been feeling apprehensive as well, lately.  He says it might just be his nerves...
ch6-528=I have been requested by Fester to deliver some oils to Tempest, who, Fester says, needs them to enchant a weapon.
ch6-529=I had an opportunity to speak to the inquisitive man I sent to Phelic today.  If Phelic is to serve as a measure of what a Sage should be, this newcomer -- I didn't catch his name -- fits it perfectly.  He has given me a trinket to show his gratitude...
ch6-530=Khaele has decided to remain in Avalon with Pell, saying that it is for the better that they both remain.  He worries not about how deeply the Council may frown upon his decision.
ch6-531=The Magistrate named Khaele has decided to forego his business with Pell because, as she says, they will both be of far better use defending Avalon.
ch6-532=I came to ask Lahren about Pell's involvement with Khaele today, but he turned me right back to her, saying all he knows is hearsay.
ch6-533=Elarath has disabled the portal, for it taxes him a bit to keep it open.  He adds that he feels an omen that has convinced him that we must all be at our best...
ch6-534=Elazar suffers from a curse, Elarath has told me -- One that he believes the Sha'ahoul must have adapted from the Naga, or discovered while on the Astral Plane.  Its classification as a "mystical illness" seems to suggest it is to be placed on those with magical abilities.
ch6-535=The incantation that will free Elazar from this curse requires one of purity, and a few strange components, which Elarath believes I may be able to procure from Olon or the merchant Rayous.
ch6-536=Grimstone Root and Swampfire Flower are the two material components needed for the incantation.
ch6-537=In addition to Sir Roth, Mudam also requests that I consult with him.
chx-001=Roth's personal page, Entrowe, has informed me that Sir Roth has an assignment for me.  Entrowe entreats me to return to him when I am finished -- whether I accept the assignment or not -- for, apparently, I have become "in demand..."
chx-002=Mudam wasn't put off at all when I did not accept his assignment; he merely made mention that my brother, since he is feeling much better, would be more than happy to accept.  I should consult Entrowe to see who else needs my assistance.
chx-003=Sir Roth thanked me for being honest when I refused his mission; surely Corvus has more experience than I in the area of fighting skills!  I wonder if Entrowe has heard from anyone else who seeks my help.
chx-004=Mudam has an assignment that begs completion, says Entrowe.  Again, when Mudam is finished with me, I should return to Entrowe to see what other tasks need to be performed.
chx-005=I am to report to Elazar, for he needs my assistance with something he and Elarath are working on.  Entrowe bids that if I wish to leave this assignment to someone else, I return to him to check for new assignments.
chx-006=Since I have refused Elazar's assignment, Entrowe confesses that only Sir Roth and Mudam have requested my assistance of late.  I should report to the both of them.
chx-007=I wouldn't expect Elazar to be at all bothered by my refusal to assist him.  I suppose I shall check on Entrowe to see if the youngster has any heard wind of any more assignments.

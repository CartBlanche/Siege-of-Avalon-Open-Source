[Harold1]
Say=Can't you see I'm busy, boy?  Move along.
Adventure=ch1-04;
RspDflt=Sorry to bother you, sir.

[Harold2]
Say=You may be some new hero around here, but I still don't have time for your nonsense.  Out of my way!
RspDflt=Pardon me, sir.

[haroldthree]
Say=Yes?  Something I can help you with?
RspDflt=Excuse me, I was looking for someone else.
RspTxt1=Actually, I was about to ask you the same thing.
nxtln1=haroldthree2
rspcnd2=all(ttl(03mabonquest,!03mabondone):obj(!statusharold));
RspTxt2=Yes, as a matter of fact.  Sir Mabon has taken over General Ovoron's position, and has found the documentation in his new office to be lacking in several respects.  Consequently, he has sent me to retrieve your latest status report.
nxtln2=statusreport

[haroldthree2]
Say=Well, yes, actually.  I'm very glad you asked!  I am Lord Harold, and being one of the only Taberlanders left in the keep when our king called for our assistance to help quell the revolt, I've had occasion to think of a few things.  One of the things I've thought about is King Tortain's signet ring.  It must be recovered, and Elazar has information that will make this aim much easier to attain.  A vision, or something.
adventure=ch3-580

RspTxt1=I think you'd have more luck finding the proverbial needle in the haystack, friend.
nxtln1=haroldthree3
rspcnd2=all(ttl(!03hartleyquest,!03hartleyhappy));
RspTxt2=Why is it so important to find a ring, even if it is the fallen King's?
nxtln2=haroldthree6
rspcnd3=all(ttl(03hartleyquest,!03hartleyhappy):obj(!KTRing));
RspTxt3=Ah, yes.  I have already spoken to Baron Hartley regarding this signet ring.
nxtln3=haroldthree7
rspcnd4=all(ttl(03hartleyquest,03hartleyhappy):obj(!KTRing));
RspTxt4=Ah, yes.  I have already spoken to Baron Hartley regarding this signet ring.
nxtln4=haroldthree9

[haroldthree3]
Say=Indeed, and such luck I have had the entire time I've been searching for a clue, but one has recently presented itself to me.  Knowing of my intent to retrieve the ring, Sir Roth has apprised me that Elazar has had a vision of both Tortain's armor and his signet ring, which is both good and bad news.  Regardless, the ring must be recovered.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=And you'd like me to recover this ring?
nxtln1=haroldthree4
rspback=haroldthree2

[haroldthree4]
Say=Yes.  You asked how you could help me, and passing this task on to you will free me from having to worry about it.  You probably don't remember me, but I believe we've met.  Regardless, stories of your accomplishments are circulating about the keep with increasing regularity.  I believe that you are the charitable type, and in addition to that, quite competent.  You will accept this assignment, won't you?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Of course, Lord Harold.  What benefits Taberland benefits Avalon as well.
nxtln1=haroldthree5
rspcnd4=all(obj(KTRing));
RspTxt4=You're in luck, Lord Harold.  I have retrieved the ring already and it is in my possession.  Of course you may keep it until Vortigerm arrives.
nxtln4=incomplete1

[haroldthree5]
Say=Splendid!  I was right about you after all.  Ah, yes, also missing is the king's armor, which should also be returned if possible, yes...  You may wish to speak to Elazar concerning his vision, else you probably won't have the faintest idea where to look.  Return to me when you've something to report.  I thank you in advance for your contribution to our cause.

[haroldthree6]
Say=It is more than merely an heirloom.  A signet ring is like a signature.  Any document can be made to appear as though it has come from the King himself if it is sealed with this signet.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=And you'd like me to recover this ring so that you can hold it for King Vortigerm?

RspDflt=As you wish, Lord Harold.  Farewell.

[haroldthree9]
Say=You have?  What has he told you?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=[fills Lord Harold in on the details]  I have already returned the ring to Baron Hartley.
nxtln1=haroldthree10

[haroldthree10]
Say=Splendid!  At last, I can stop worrying about it.  You are truly as competent and charitable as I thought.  Baron Hartley has likely already thanked you, but I would like to do so again.  You have my earnest gratitude.

RspTxt4=No, Lord Harold, I have not yet, but I need something from you.  Sir Mabon has taken over General Ovoron's position, and has found the documentation in his new office to be lacking in several respects.  Consequently, he has sent me to retrieve your latest status report.

[incomplete1]
Say=Splendid!  At last I can stop worrying about this.  You've done me a great boon, friend; you have my earnest gratitude, and doubtless you shall also have the gratitude of His Highness when he arrives.  [He smiles.]  I don't have to tell you which one is worth more, but I shall remember your contribution.

[Kay]
Say=You don't look injured.  What can we do for you?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm new here and was just looking around.
NxtLn1=Kay1
RspTxt2=Where are you from?
NxtLn2=Kay2
RspTxt3=Have you heard any rumors?
NxtLn3=Kay3

[Kay1]
Say=Well, welcome to the chapel.  We're in the business of saving lives and souls here.  If you're ever in need of either service, we'd be happy to help.
RspDflt=That's good to know.  Thank you.
rspBack=Kay

[Kay2]
Say=I'm Nisosan.  I was injured in the fighting outside the citadel just before the siege began.  They said they might send me back on the next ship, since they thought I was now useless.  Instead, I joined up with Friar Massus, and in here I can still do some good.  With the siege, though, I think that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to stay.  Perhaps I should have gone home!
RspDflt=I'm glad you stayed.  We can use all the help we can get.
rspBack=Kay

[Kay3]
Say=One of the wounded was muttering in his sleep about deserters.  You wouldn't know anything about this, would you?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=This is the first I've heard of it.
NxtLn1=Kay4

[Kay4]
Say=Well, I suppose I'll have to make sure Sir Roth finds out.
RspDflt=Good day.
rspBack=Kay

[Chalice]
Say=Hail!  You look more battle-hardened than the last time we met.  I trust all is well?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Well enough, Kay.
NxtLn1=Chalice1
RspTxt2=What's new?
NxtLn2=Chalice2

[Chalice1]
Say=I understand entirely, sir.  Good day.
RspDflt=Good spirits protect you.
rspBack=Chalice

[Chalice2]
Say=Since last you were here, things have been improving.  I understand that the Ahoul are losing heart.  Perhaps it won't be long until we break this awful siege.
RspDflt=Let us hope so.
rspBack=Chalice

[chapter6]
Say=Oh, hello %playername%.  I'm sorry I can't speak with you now, I have business to attend to.
RspDflt=Understood.  Farewell, good monk.

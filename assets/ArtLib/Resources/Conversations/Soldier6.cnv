[Soldier]
Say=Yes?
RspTxt1=Where are you from?
NxtLn1=Soldier1
RspTxt2=Heard any good rumors?
NxtLn2=Soldier2

[Soldier1]
Say=I am from Fornax and I hope I can return soon.  I don't think the situation here will improve.  This fortress needs more able-bodied spellcasters...  And more women, if you know what I mean.

[Soldier2]
Say=Fornaxans do not gossip, sir.

[Chalice1]
Say=I came from Fornax, sir.  At first, I didn't think we'd make it, but everyone's hopes rise higher every day, and we have you to thank.
rspBack=chalice

[Chalice2]
Say=Since Fornaxans do not gossip, this is not gossip.  Understand?  Okay.  I hear that a new supply ship will arrive within the next week.  Finally, we'll be able to eat properly!

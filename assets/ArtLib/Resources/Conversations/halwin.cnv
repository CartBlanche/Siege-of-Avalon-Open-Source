Say=I sailed here from Nisos, sir.  Unfortunately, my ship, the Bleeding Siren, was burned.  Now, I'm forced to fight from my land legs.
RspDflt=Well, I'm glad you are with us.  We need every soldier we can get.
rspBack=Halwin

[Halwin2]
Say=I heard Nicophorus is planning a raid on an Ahoul camp up the river!  My source isn't too reliable, but we could sure use the supplies.
RspDflt=That we could.  Good day.
rspBack=Halwin

[chalice]
Say=I see the village brought out the soldier who was in you.  I knew Corvus' brother would make a fine warrior.
RspDflt=Thank you for the kind words.
RspTxt1=What's new?
NxtLn1=chalice1

[chalice1]

[three2]
Say=Longin' for the old days, sir.  I miss the crisp smell of the waters.  Say, did you hear that the Sha'ahoul have something planned?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I believe I've heard that one before, why?
nxtln1=three3

[three3]
Say=Oh, there's been some activity to the south of Avalon, have you heard?  The scum are out there at all hours of the night, doing their demonic deeds!  It's true!
adventure=ch3-532
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Interesting.  Do you have any idea what they're doing?
nxtln1=three4

[three4]
Say=That's the Creator's own knowledge, right there, but you know they can't be up to any good!
RspDflt=Certainly not.  Thank you for the information, soldier, and farewell.

[cleared]
Say=Hey!  You got rid of them, right?  It was you, wasn't it?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I'm afraid I haven't a clue what you're talking about.
nxtln1=cleared2

[cleared2]
Say=Sure you do!  The Ahoul we've been seeing to the south of the keep!  You've destroyed them!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, I did help to remove their threat from the area.
nxtln1=cleared3

[cleared3]
Say=Congratulations!  You know, at first I didn't believe the stories about you, but that's amazing!  Hey, take care of yourself, huh?
RspDflt=I plan to.  Thank you, soldier.  Stay safe.

[chapter6]
Say=Huh? Oh, %playername%! I was only just thinking of sending for you. I am uneasy, friend.  The Sha'ahoul have been especially calm today.  Something is amiss.
RspDflt=Farewell.
RspTxt1=So you think they're getting ready to attack?

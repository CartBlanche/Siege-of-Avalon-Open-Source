Say1=
goto1=Soldier

[Soldier]
Say=Is there a problem, lad?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=No problem.  I'm new so I wanted to meet some of the officers.
NxtLn1=Soldier1

[Soldier1]
Say=A good many of them are leaving with Ovoron shortly.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I know.  My brother is among them.
NxtLn1=Soldier2
RspTxt2=Yes, I'd heard about the raid.  Do you think they will be successful?
NxtLn2=Soldier3

[Soldier2]
Say=Who is your brother?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=His name is Corvus and he is with the Elythrians.
NxtLn1=Soldier4

[Soldier4]
Say=I know the name, but I've never actually met him.  It's said that General Roth asks Corvus' advice now and again.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Why would a man like General Roth listen to my brother?
NxtLn1=Soldier5

[Soldier5]
Say=It's probably been a while since you last saw him, but your brother is quite a soldier.  Few know the area surrounding Avalon as well as he.  He is a brave and excellent scout, as well as expert swordsman.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=You're right.  It has been a long time since I last saw my brother.  He looked harder.
NxtLn1=Soldier6
RspTxt2=I always knew Corvus would be a great warrior.  I hope I can follow in his footsteps.
NxtLn2=Soldier7

[Soldier6]
Say=I would expect so.  He's a veteran of this siege and a leader by example.  If he orders his men into a fight, its because he's already there.
RspDflt=Then he's a good leader too.  I must see to my training.  Good day.

[Soldier7]
Say=They are large one's to follow in.  Your brother has many friends here and quite a reputation.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I don't want to be my brother.  I just want make my family proud and honor my father's name.
NxtLn1=Soldier8

[Soldier8]
Say=A good sentiment.  Let me warn you though.  There is very little happening here that has honor.  I have done few things here which I am proud of.  Your brother probably feels the same.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Surely you are proud to defend the Seven Kingdoms.
NxtLn1=Soldier9

[Soldier9]
Say=Yes.  I have also done things here that I will not speak of.  Mark my word:  Regret is a constant companion to a soldier.
RspDflt=I understand.  Good luck to you.

[Soldier3]
Say=Success?  That would be new.  So far all of our offensives have been met with defeat and slaughter.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Holding out for his long surely can be marked as a success.
NxtLn1=Soldier10

[Soldier10]
Say=Perhaps, unless you consider it the dragging out of our own deaths.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Are all of your countrymen so glum?
NxtLn1=Soldier11

[Soldier11]
Say=Of course.  Were you from Oriam, you would be glum as well.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=No I wouldn't.  I would take heart in that so many have come to my aid.
NxtLn1=Soldier12
RspTxt2=Perhaps, but I would also try to salvage as much as I can.
NxtLn2=Soldier13

[Soldier12]
Say=Take heart?  Our country is a warzone.  If we lose, everything is lost, even our lives.  If we win, we are left with no home, lost family and a devastated countryside.  Why should I take heart in that a few hundred outlanders have come to die here with me?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm sorry.  I had never thought of it like that.
NxtLn1=Soldier14

[Soldier14]
Say=Obviously not.  I don't blame you.
RspDflt=Thank you for your pardon.  I will take my leave now.

[Soldier13]
Say=Everything worth salvaging has been claimed by the alliance in the fight against the Ahoul.  That's all I have left.  When the fighting is over, then what?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Then you rebuild and make your country stronger.
NxtLn1=Soldier15

[Soldier15]
Say=A nice sentiment, but an unrealistic one.  Perhaps you are needed elsewhere.
RspDflt=I think, in fact, that I am.  Good day.

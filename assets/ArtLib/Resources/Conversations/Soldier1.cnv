[Soldier]
Say=What can I do for you?
RspDflt=Nothing, soldier.  Pardon me.
RspTxt1=Where are you from?
NxtLn1=Soldier1
RspTxt2=Heard any good rumors?
NxtLn2=Soldier2

[Soldier1]
Say=My home country is Cathea.  It seems farther from here with every passing day.  I miss my dog.  I wasn't allowed to bring him here because of "health issues" and the shortage of food.
RspDflt=Interesting.  Farewell.
rspBack=soldier

[Soldier2]
Say=A good source told me that there's now some bread for soldiers.  If I were you, I'd be the first in line at the mess hall tonight!
RspDflt=I'm glad to hear that, soldier.  Thank you.
rspBack=soldier

[Chalice]
Say=Ah, the hero graces my small part of Avalon!  What can I do for you, sir?
RspDflt=Nothing, soldier.  Just passing through.  Farewell.
RspTxt1=Where are you from?
NxtLn1=Chalice1
RspTxt2=Heard any good rumors?
NxtLn2=Chalice2

[Chalice1]
Say=I've come here from Cathea to fight the Ahoul.  I must admit that I didn't do it just for the battle...  A friend of mine was among the first to inhabit Avalon.  He was slain in the line of duty, and, well, I wish to pay the Ahoul back in spades.  With you among us, I know we will be victorious!
RspDflt=Interesting.  Farewell.
rspBack=chalice

[Chalice2]
Say=No, sir, never had much use for rumor, m'self.
RspDflt=Agreed, soldier.  Farewell.
rspBack=chalice

[fourup]
Say=%playername%!  I've been thinking about something, and I'd like to know what you think.  If one of the Sha'ahoul -- one of the human ones, mind you -- went traitor to their side and decided to join us, would you let him?
RspDflt=I haven't the time for this.  Farewell.
RspTxt1=I suppose so.  He would be watched carefully enough and likely never trusted until his people were vanquished.
nxtln1=fourup2
RspTxt2=Of course not!  We have enough trouble with traitors in our own midst without letting one of the enemy into our ranks and into our trust!
nxtln2=fourup3

[fourup2]
Say=Hmm.  I'm not so trusting as you, %playername%, but thank you for your opinion.  I shall think on it.
RspDflt=You are welcome.  Farewell, soldier.

[fourup3]
Say=I agree, %playername%, but the question remains, what are we to do with them once they are defeated? Thank you for your opinion.  I shall think on it.
RspDflt=You are welcome.  Farewell, soldier.

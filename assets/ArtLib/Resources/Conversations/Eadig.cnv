[Eadig]
Say=Hey!  You want to take my place here for a few hours?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I don't think that kind of personnel switch would be allowed.
NxtLn1=Eadig1

[Eadig1]
Say=Oh, come on!  Give me a few hours off to go give one of the kitchen wenches a good... er, talking to!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm sorry, but I'm on business of my own.
NxtLn1=Eadig2

[Eadig2]
Say=Fine, then.  Leave me to this monotonous job, then.  See if I ever do a favor for you!
RspDflt=I'm sorry.  Perhaps the next soldier to come along will relieve you.

[Chalice]
Say=Hey there!  About last time, I'm sorry.  I was just bored out of my skull.  I didn't mean to make you feel obligated to me.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Think nothing of it.  I understand completely.
NxtLn1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=Thank you, sir.  Good day to you!
RspDflt=Good day.

[three]
Say=My sword hasn't been used in a long time.  At least, not for what it was made for.  I still take care of it.  It's sharp enough for me to shave with it.  The other soldiers give me strange looks.  I also use it to cut cheese.
RspDflt=I'll go talk to them about it.  Goodbye.
RspTxt1=That's fascinating.  So, tell me, what do you do to keep busy and interested when you're on the job?
nxtln1=three2

[three2]
Say=I'm glad you asked!  Fighting roaches!  If you put some earwax on their feelers, they can't see quite right, or somethin', and they'll bite at anything that moves!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Uh, sure, just let me get some earwax and we can let the games begin.
nxtln1=three3
RspTxt2=Are you taking wagers?
nxtln2=three4

[three3]
Say=Oh, you won't need to, look, I've got plenty-
RspDflt=Oh my, what time is it?  I've got, ah, a meeting with General Roth.  Perhaps later.

[three4]
Say=Hey, I never thought of that, that's a good idea!  Pick me up some extra coins on the off hours!  Hey, you got a hat I can borrow?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What would you need a hat for?
nxtln1=three5

[three5]
Say=Well, I figure I have to catch a few for the wagers tonight, and-
RspDflt=You're a sick man, Eadig.  Goodbye.
RspTxt1=Oh, no you don't!
nxtln1=three6

[three6]
Say=Oh, fine.  I guess I'll just use my purse.
RspDflt=You do that, Eadig.  Good day.

[fivesix]
Say=Have you come to place your bets, %playername%?
RspDflt=Err, no, soldier, I haven't.  Please excuse me...
RspTxt1=Bets?
nxtln1=fivesix2

[fivesix2]
Say=On the roaches!  They're in short supply, so the bets have gone up.  Personally, I'd place my bet on the black one.  They're born fighters.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=They're both black!
nxtln1=fivesix3
RspTxt2=Are all bets made so informed?
nxtln2=fivesix4

[fivesix3]
Say=[He looks at his loathesome prizefighters with an expression of epiphany.]  So you're right!  I may have to change the board on this one!
RspDflt=Good luck with that, soldier; I've things to attend to...

[fivesix4]
Say=No, no!  Special for you, %playername%, I reveal the secrets of gambling!
RspDflt=I've little use for more money, soldier.  Farewell.

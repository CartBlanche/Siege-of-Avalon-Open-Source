[Maslin]
Say=Greetings, sir.  What brings you to this corner of Avalon?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm on business of my own.
NxtLn1=Maslin1

[Maslin1]
Say=Sounds like the secret kind, sir.  I won't pry.
RspDflt=Thank you for your consideration.  Good day.

[Chalice]
Say=Hello again.  Still running about on your secret mission?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=It's not as secretive as you might imagine.  I'm merely doing my duty.
NxtLn1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=That's all a good soldier can do, isn't it?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Perhaps.  There are some who go beyond the call of duty, though.
NxtLn1=Chalice2

[Chalice2]
Say=True.  I suspect you may be one of that type of soldier.
RspDflt=I thank you for the compliment.  Good day to you.

[untoldfour]
Say=Good day, sir.  How goes it?
RspDflt=Pardon me, Maslin, I was looking for someone else.
RspTxt1=It goes well; Maslin, thank you for asking.  What's happening in South Gate these days?
nxtln1=untoldfour2

[untoldfour2]
Say=Everybody's on edge, sir.  It's like they expect the alarm to be raised and Sha'ahoul to spilling into South Gate.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Do you have any idea what's causing this uneasiness?
nxtln1=untoldfour3

[untoldfour3]
Say=No, but it's making me uneasy.
RspDflt=Er...  Yes.  Excuse me while I get to the root of this problem.

[toldfour]
Say=Do you know what's happening?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Elazar had a bad dream, and he was worried about it.
nxtln1=toldfour2
RspTxt2=Elazar had a disturbing vision, but I will soon resolve the problems his Vision has revealed to him.
nxtln2=toldfour3

[toldfour2]
Say=Don't you think he's a bit old to be having nightmares?
RspDflt=I do not presume such.  Excuse me, soldier, I must be on my way.

[toldfour3]
Say=Oh...  Good.  I guess everyone will stop worrying, now.  That is good.
RspDflt=Yes it is, soldier.  If you'll excuse me...

[chapter6]
Say=%playername%! Have you heard? Elazar has fallen ill! He deserves it. The spirits are punishing him for practicing magic.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm trying to do something to help him. You shouldn't be so hateful of something you don't understand.
nxtln1=chapter6b

[chapter6b]
Say=I don't care. He's a seer. They're evil and they don't belong here! Avalon is a place for the common folk to live in peace. She's been reduced to rubble now, and it's all because of the strange folk that come to exploit her security.
RspDflt=I'm sorry you feel that way. Farewell.

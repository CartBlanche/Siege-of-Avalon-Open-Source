[Soldier]
Say=Hey, there.
RspTxt1=And where are you from?
NxtLn1=Soldier1
RspTxt2=Have you kept your ears open?
NxtLn2=Soldier2

[Soldier1]
Say=My home is in Oriam.  At least it was in Oriam, before the Ahoul burned it.  If I had the chance, I would dismantle them myself, but we can't afford to spare any men for anything but defense.  Always waiting for reinforcements...

[Soldier2]
Say=Our Captain said for us to be wary of an attack tonight.  He has a strange sense about this sort of thing, so I'd sleep near my sword if I were you.  The Ahoul have been too quiet lately -- they've got to be up to something!

[Chalice]
Say=May I be of assistance to you, sir?
RspTxt1=Tell me, where are you from?
NxtLn1=Chalice1
RspTxt2=Heard any good rumors?
NxtLn2=Chalice2

[Chalice1]
Say=I am from Oriam, sir.  At least it was in Oriam, before the Ahoul burned it.  They're going to get paid back with interest.  Those grass-dwellers will pay.
rspBack=Chalice

[Chalice2]
Say=I heard the Catheans have sent for their reserves.  Perhaps they can help to break this siege.  I hope they bring some soap.  Supplies are low and soldiers are becoming ... fragrant.

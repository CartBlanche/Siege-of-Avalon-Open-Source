[Crosby1]
Say=We are here to serve, soldier.  Come back if you ever have need of us.
Adventure=ch1-21;
RspDflt=Thank you.

[Crosby2]
Say=I am from Elythria, sir, though I have served here for several years.  Friar Massus has trained me well in the art of healing; if you ever have need of my skills, just ask.
Adventure=ch1-21;
RspDflt=I appreciate the offer, Brother.

[Crosby3]
Say=The wounded pile on top of each other.  The Ahoul are extracting a terrible price from us.  We work all day and night, but the wounded keep coming in.  The good spirits will shine on us, though.
RspDflt=I hope they do, Brother.

[brother]
Say=Praise be, Corvus!  Rest assured we will take good care of your brother.

RspDflt=Thank you, Brother Crosby.

[NoChalice2]
Say=Food is scarce.  If something doesn't happen soon, there will be nothing to feed the hungry patients.
RspDflt=Things will change soon.

[Chalice]
Say=We have all heard of your success!  Thank you, and congratulations!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=It was my duty.  What's new around here?

rspcnd2=All(stt(wounds>0));
RspTxt2=I find myself in need of healing.
NxtLn2=Chalice2

[Chalice1]
Say=Things have been steadily improving ever since you brought back the Chalice.  Patients heal faster, the religious soldiers have all taken heart and morale is improving.  Your deed is having a wonderful effect!
RspDflt=That's good to know.  Thank you, Brother.

[Chalice2]
Say=Of course.  Let me take a look.

RspTxt1=I find myself in need of healing.
NxtLn1=Chalice2
RspTxt2=I have come to inquire of my brother's condition.  It is you who have been attending him, is it not?
nxtln2=three2

[three2]
Say=I'm afraid he is still recovering.  We've done what we can, now we must give him time.  It is a strange miracle that he was so coherent when he arrived.  I'm sure the weight of the past few days is still crashing down on him.  Rest assured that he is in all our prayers.
adventure=ch3-518
RspDflt=Thank you for everything, Brother Crosby.  Farewell.

[chapter5]
Say=And what can I do for you, my son?
RspDflt=Sorry to have bothered you.
rspcnd1=All(stt(wounds>-1));
RspTxt1=I am in need of healing.
NxtLn1=Chalice2
RspTxt2=I'm looking for my brother.
nxtln2=chapter5b

[chapter5b]
Say=Your brother left the infirmary some time ago. It seems the heroic thread binds your family, %playername%. Corvus couldn't wait to transfer back into service.
RspDflt=Oh, I should have known that. Farewell, brother.

[6intro]
Say=I'm so glad you've come, %playername%.  Elazar has been ailing for some time now, and we fear he is not long for this world.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=How can I help?
nxtln1=i2

[i2]
Say=Since you were so effective in aiding the Catheans when King Isdernus was poisoned, some of my brethren suggested that we seek your assistance.  In truth, we are unsure as to the exact nature of his affliction, but we thought your experience might enable you to shed some light on the matter.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Next to your order, my knowledge must be quite limited; still, I will be glad to help if I can.
nxtln1=i3

[i3]
Say=We have tried all the mundane remedies we know of without success.  Perhaps you could help us find some mystical cure for his strange ailment.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I suppose I should seek the council of one of our resident mages, for they might have some clue about this strange affliction.
nxtln1=i4

[i4]
Say=I would recommend Elarath -- I spoke with him some time ago, but he seemed terribly busy.  He had some information that might help, I believe, but he did not have the time to look for it when Elazar's situation was less critical.
script=player.addtitle(06ttcrosby);
adventure=ch6-014;
RspDflt=I am off to seek his wisdom, Brother Crosby.  Farewell.

[progress]
Say=Have you found the necessary incantation and ingredients?
RspDflt=Nay, but I shall return when I know more.

RspDflt=I shall, Brother Crosby.

RspDflt=I will seek him out immediately.

Say=Excellent! [accepts items and mixes them in crucible]  Now we can perform the incantation.

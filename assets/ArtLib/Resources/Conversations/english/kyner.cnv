[Kyner1]
Say=Hello there, lad.  My name is Kyner.  I was a good friend of your brother.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I am pleased to meet you.  Were you with the search party?
NxtLn1=Kyner2

[Kyner2]
Say=Yes, I was.  We searched the village and found nothing but voreworms.  We ended up killing quite a few of them before we left.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=There was no sign of him?
NxtLn1=Kyner3

[Kyner3]
Say=I'm sorry, but we saw no trace of him.  A battle had been fought recently just south of the old Wizard's Tower, but there's no telling who or what did the fighting.  Could have been anything.

RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Thank you for looking.
NxtLn1=Kyner4

[Kyner4]
Say=It's the least I could do.  Your brother saved me from losing my leg once and I've yet to repay the favor.
RspDflt=I am certain that you shall still have your chance.  Good day to you.

[three]
Say=Would you like me to accompany you on your mission?  I'd appreciate the opportunity to stretch my legs and my sword-arm, and perhaps bring back a few Ahoul scalps and some fresh battle tales as well!
RspDflt=Perhaps later, Sir Kyner.
RspTxt1=Good idea, Sir Kyner.  We'll be on our way shortly.

[Frollo]
Say=What's this?!  I don't think you have permission to be up here, do you?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Permission?  I'm just having a look around.  No one said this place was off-limits.
NxtLn1=Frollo1

[Frollo1]
Say=Well, I'm saying it is now!  You get out of here before I gut you!
RspDflt=Yes, sir.  I'm sorry to have bothered you.

[three]
Say=You may think you're a hotshot, but that still doesn't give you license to be prowling about!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What would I have to gain from prowling around here?  Have you something to hide?
nxtln1=three2

[three2]
Say=Are you accusing me of something?
RspDflt=Certainly not, Sir Frollo.  I'll be on my way.
RspTxt1=No, I am not.  Why are you being so defensive?
nxtln1=three3

[three3]
Say=I don't have to explain myself to you.  Kindly be on your way.
RspDflt=I'll leave you to your bottled rage, then, Sir Frollo.  Goodbye.

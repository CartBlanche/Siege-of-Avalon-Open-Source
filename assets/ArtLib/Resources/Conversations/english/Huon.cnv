[Huon]
Say=Hi!  Could you do us a favor?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=If time permits.
NxtLn1=Huon1

[Huon1]
Say=There's a scratching downstairs.  We all think it's rats.  Could you have the General send over a few cats or something?  It's keeping us up at night!
RspDflt=I'm sorry, but I think the General has more important things to deal with right now.
rspCnd1=all(ttl(01Bugs2));
RspTxt1=Since giant beetles were discovered in the kitchen basement earlier today, we suspect that there are more beneath South Gate.  I'm planning on looking into the situation later.
nxtLn1=Bugs

[Bugs]
Say=Beetles?  Even worse than rats!  I hope you kill them all, and quickly!
RspDflt=I will do my best.  Good day.

[Chalice]
Say=So, you'd be the one who found the Chalice of Life!  Thank you much, lad!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Just doing my duty as a soldier of Avalon.
NxtLn1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=It must have been quite an adventure.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=It almost proved to be more than I could handle!
NxtLn1=Chalice2

[Chalice2]
Say=Somehow I doubt that!  Good day to you, sir.
RspDflt=Good day.

[three]
Say=Good day, sir.
RspDflt=Excuse me, soldier.
RspTxt1=I was wondering if you had any advice for me.
nxtln1=three2

[three2]
Say=As a matter of fact, I do.  You know that Olon character?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What of him?
nxtln1=three3

[three3]
Say=I don't like the looks of him.  I'd be careful around him if I were you!
adventure=ch3-533
RspDflt=Thank you for the advice, soldier.  Farewell.

[chapter6]
Say=Ah, %playername%. Where is your wagon of Ahoul carcasses? Have you not yet again returned from the field victorious?
RspDflt=I knew I had forgottten something...
RspTxt1=I left the monsters to draw their final breaths at the very places where they dared to challenge me.
nxtln1=chapter6c
RspTxt2=What do we need with a wagon of scum inside these sacred walls?
nxtln2=chapter6b

[chapter6b]
Say=I see your point, and I agree. Maybe these villains will trip on the bodies of their brothers and be defeated.
RspDflt=I doubt that, but one can hope. Farewell.
RspTxt1=Piles of Ahoul heaped around the castle would do wonders for their morale, eh?
nxtln1=chapter6c

[chapter6c]
Say=Haha! You are truly becoming a leader! I will be honored to fight beside you when the time comes.
RspDflt=Likewise, Huon. Farewell.

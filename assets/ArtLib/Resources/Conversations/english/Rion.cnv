Say=I'm sorry, but the village is off-limits for the remainder of this preview.  Buy the next chapter, and I'll see what I can do.
RspDflt=Very well.

[Rion]
Say=Hello.  You must be Corvus' brother.  You have the same look about you.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I am.  How did you know my brother?
nxtLn1=Rion1

[Rion1]
Say=He and I were great friends.  I'd wager to say I've never had a better one.  I was broken when I heard he had disappeared.  I don't believe a word of what they say, though.  There's no way a soldier of your brother's skill could ever just roll over like that.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Thank you for your sympathy.  I'm sure Corvus will be glad when he hears of your confidence in him.
nxtLn1=Rion2

[Rion2]
Say=Don't believe everything you hear from the guys upstairs.  They don't know your brother like I know him.  He's still alive.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I think so, too.
nxtLn1=Rion3

[Rion3]
Say=By the way, be careful around South Gate.  I've been stationed here for a long time and there are strange things afoot lately.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Strange things?
nxtLn1=Rion4

[Rion4]
Say=Yeah.  Soldiers are looking over their shoulders more often and trusting each other less, a bad thing in a time of war.  If you can't trust the man you're defending a wall with, who can you trust?
RspDflt=Perhaps it's just nerves.  Thanks again for your confidence.

[NoChalice]
Say=We meet again.  How have you fared?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I have been well.  What's the latest from South Gate?
nxtln1=NoChalice1

[NoChalice1]
Say=More of the same. The soldiers grow anxious from waiting.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Waiting beats dying, does it not?
nxtln1=NoChalice2

[NoChalice2]
Say=Aye, but fighting beats waiting.
RspDflt=As you say, Rion.  Take care.

[Chalice]
Say=Good tidings to you!  Your exploits in the village have brought you great renown!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm not here to acquire fame; rather, to do my duty.
nxtln1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=Come, now!  We are all here to gain glory.  It's part of what makes us soldiers.  Don't be afraid to admit it, lad!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Perhaps.  But I'm more interested in winning the war than making a name for myself.
nxtln1=Chalice1

[three]
Say=Ho, glory-seeker!  How have you been faring?
RspDflt=none
rspcnd1=all(obj(!KTChestPlate));
RspTxt1=I've done pretty well for myself, actually.  I guess I'll worry about enjoying myself once the Ahoul are subjugated!
nxtln1=three2
rspcnd2=all(obj(KTChestPlate));
RspTxt2=I've done pretty well for myself, actually.  I guess I'll worry about enjoying myself once the Ahoul are subjugated!
nxtln2=three6

[three2]
Say=Hold on there, tiger!  Leave a few for the rest of us!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Why?  It makes little sense to exterminate them.  Would we not be descending as deeply into barbarism as they have?
nxtln1=three3

[three3]
Say=Then what?  I'd hope that any religion that would preach such destruction would be wrong, but I doubt they will ever be made to believe that.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=You have a good point there, soldier.  The truth is, I don't know the answer.  We must hope that it will occur to us.
nxtln1=three4

[three4]
Say=Hope is a precious commodity, Corvu-...  Oh.  I'm sorry.  I seem to remember having this conversation with your brother.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Really?  What did he say?
nxtln1=three5

[three5]
Say=Pretty much what you said, with negligible differences.  I always marveled at his optimism.  A fine commander.  Say, if you get a chance to speak with him, tell him Rion inquires after his health and wishes him well.
RspDflt=I'll do that, Rion.  Farewell.

[three6]
Say=Say, leave a few for...  Wait a second, if I'm not mistaken, isn't that King Tortain's armor?!?  I saw a drawing of it once...  No, that couldn't be it.  Yes, it is!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=You can stop doubting yourself, Rion.  It is King Tortain's armor.
nxtln1=three7

[three7]
Say=Impressive.  At any rate, I was trying to say, leave a few of those Ahoul for us!  Having a one-man army might be nice, but...  [laughing]
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Why?  It makes little sense to exterminate them.  Wouldn't we be as barbaric as they?
nxtln1=three3

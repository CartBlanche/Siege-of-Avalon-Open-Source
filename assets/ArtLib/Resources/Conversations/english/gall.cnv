[Gall]
Say=Come closer, son!  How can you see my fine goods from that distance?
Adventure=ch1-59;
RspDflt=I think I'll be on my way.
RspTxt1=If your prices are fair, I may buy something.
script1=merchant
RspTxt2=In truth, I cannot, although I doubt that would help much.
NxtLn2=Gall2

[Gall2]
Say=What's that supposed to mean?
RspDflt=It matters not.  Listen, I must be on my way.  Good day to you.
RspTxt1=I'm afraid I've not had a chance to amass much money yet.
NxtLn1=Gall3

[Gall3]
Say=Well, that's all right, son!  Most of us merchants will buy, as well, so if you've got a few things you've no use for any more, you can sell them for something you need.
RspDflt=I'll come back when I'm in a haggling mood.  Farewell.
RspTxt1=I have a few such items.  Let me see your wares, please.
script1=merchant

[Gall4]
Say=Welcome back! I'm supposing you have some strange new Ahoul weapons for me?
RspDflt=No, I do not.  Farewell.
RspTxt1=You've been selling those to soldiers?
Nxtln1=Gall5
RspTxt2=I might have something.  Let me see your wares, please.
script2=merchant

[Gall5]
Say=Most soldiers don't care much for them, but a few have been curious. They are of fine craftsmanship for such savages, eh?
RspDflt=They have put many dents in my armor, Gall.  I'll try to pick up anything interesting if I see it.  Farewell.

[chapter6]
Say=That Wilfred...  Scared of money he is!  Money's one thing I'll ne'er fear.  Ha!  So what can I do for you?
RspDflt=Nothing, thank you.  I'm off.
RspTxt1=What do you have?
script1=merchant
RspTxt2=Where can you possibly spend any money here?
nxtln2=chapter6b

[chapter6b]
Say=Er...  Spend it?  Well, I used to visit Gentza's pub from time to time, and I used to buy Anora's pies every week to give to high paying customers.  But, with this blamed siege lasting so long, I can't say that I care for those things much anymore.  I've a full purse as of late.
RspDflt=Heh, me too.  Farewell.
RspTxt1=Maybe, but will your gold buy your life from the Ahoul?
nxtln1=chapter6c

[chapter6c]
Say=No, but on the chance that this blasted war ends with me alive, I'll make a wagonload of gold with my store of weapons from those savages.  I'll sell them at the main gate!  The children will be begging for them!
RspDflt=I can't believe some people. Farewell.
RspTxt1=Let me see your wares, you old fool.
script1=merchant

[Wilfrid]
Say=Greetings.  I'm Wilfrid, the tanner.  I make leather goods of all kinds.  Would you care to take a look?
Adventure=ch1-32;
RspDflt=Not right now.
RspTxt1=Yes, I think I would like to see your merchandise.
script1=merchant

[Wilfrid2]
Say=Welcome back, %playername%. You still have use for my leather goods?
RspDflt=I'm sorry.  I thought you were someone else.
RspTxt1=It protected the cow for a time, I suppose.

[chapter6]
Say=How fares you this day, sir?  I regret that I have no more wares.  There remains nothing for me to buy in these cursed walls, and I carry my purse in fear as it is.  I will sell nothing else, as I must tend to closing up this shop.
RspDflt=I understand. Farewell, Wilfred.

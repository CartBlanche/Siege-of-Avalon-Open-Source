[Village1]
Say=I see the village hasn't defeated you yet.  That's good news.  What can I do for you?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I've just come to get the latest news from Avalon.
nxtLn1=Village2

[Village2]
Say=You can get gossip from any common soldier, son.  I'm sorry, but I haven't the time just now.
RspDflt=I'm sorry to have bothered you.

[transfered1]
Say=You belong to Mudam now, son. You will have to discuss further matters with him.
RspDflt=Very well, Sir Roth.

[Transfered2]
Say=What brings you back here?  Did Mudam not grant you permission to go outside Avalon?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=No, I have my permission.  I was curious to know if you knew anything about the land outside the citadel.
NxtLn1=transfered3

[transfered3]
Say=I'm afraid I can't help you, lad.  I'm in charge of the general defense of Avalon.  General Ovoron is our assault commander.  Were he here, he would be the one to ask.
RspDflt=I see.  Thank you for your help.

[chalice1]
Say=You return!  It's good to see you, lad!  Your exploits are the talk of the citadel.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Thank you, General.  Is there any news?
NxtLn1=chalice2

[chalice2]
Say=You've probably already heard this, but relief is on the way.  Just a few short weeks and all will be well.
RspDflt=Excellent news!  Thank you, sir!

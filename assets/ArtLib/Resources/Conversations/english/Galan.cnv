[Galan]
Say=Hey, there!  What's happening inside Avalon?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Nothing.  Training and waiting.
NxtLn1=Galan1

[Galan1]
Say=Aye, only the waiting part goes on in here.  It's starting to get on my nerves.  I don't like the look of some of the fellows in South Gate anymore.  I almost think some of them are up to no good.  I suppose all this waiting is making me suspicious.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Idle waiting can do that.
NxtLn1=Galan2

[Galan2]
Say=So it can.  Good day to you.
RspDflt=And you.

[Chalice]
Say=Hello again.  How are things?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Well as can be, I suppose.  And you?
NxtLn1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=Boring as ever here in South Gate.  Everyone's talking about your find, though.  Can you believe the Chalice of Life is back?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I can hardly believe I found it!
NxtLn1=Chalice2

[Chalice2]
Say=Excellent work, sir.
RspDflt=Thank you.  Take care.

[three]
Say='Lo there, Cupfinder!  I heard of your exploits with the Earthstone!  Fine piece of work.  You'll be at the top of the ladder before you know it!  Maybe get a barony of your own, a nice stronghold...
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I will have time for such fantasy when this siege is at an end.
nxtln1=three2

[three2]
Say=Right.  Fantasy is all that can manage to bring me outside of these walls right now, so please, don't disrupt it.
RspDflt=I wouldn't dream of it.  Farewell.
RspTxt1=I apologize.  I did not mean to...
nxtln1=three3

[three3]
Say=Actually, you didn't.  I'm just a bit touchy.  I wish I were out in the fields again, with the butterflies dancing and the...
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Stay focused, soldier.  You will see your fields once again.
nxtln1=three4

[three4]
Say=You really think so?  Wow, won't that be wonderful...  Ah, the smell, I can almost smell it right now...
RspDflt=I give up.  Enjoy your reverie.  Farewell.

[fivesix]
Say=You see, the end will soon arrive, and I will be out in the cool loam under the trees and the sun will be shining on a shimmering field of green...
RspDflt=I hope so, soldier.  Farewell.
RspTxt1=Such a vivid image, soldier!  I daresay you're in the wrong profession!
nxtln1=fivesix2

[fivesix2]
Say=Wha?  I...  [He blushes floridly from his cheeks.]  Mother said something like that when I signed up...
RspDflt=I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable, neighbor.  Please pardon me.

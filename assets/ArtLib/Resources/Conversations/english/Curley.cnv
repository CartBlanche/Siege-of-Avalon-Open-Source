[Curley]
Say=Greetings, sir.  How may I assist you?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I have just arrived and am looking around.
NxtLn1=Curley1
RspTxt2=Where are you from?
NxtLn2=Curley2
RspTxt3=I was just hunting for rumors.  Have you heard any?
NxtLn3=Curley3

[Curley1]
Say=As you can see, this is where we monks do our praying and healing.  If you ever have need of healing, come see Brother Crosby.  He's by far the best.
RspDflt=Thank you for the information.
rspBack=Curley

[Curley2]
Say=I am Cathean, sir.  I tried my hand as a fighter, but found that I had neither the strength nor the constitution for bloodshed.  Instead, I found my true calling as a monk.
RspDflt=And a good thing, too.  Avalon has need of skilled healers.
rspBack=Curley

[Curley3]
Say=A friend tells me that South Gate almost fell last night.  I would keep away from there, were I you -- unless, of course, you wish to be impaled on an Ahoul spear.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I doubt South Gate could be breached, and I am no coward.  If there is a fight, I will be in the thick of it -- duty demands no less.
NxtLn1=Curley4

[Curley4]
Say=As you say, sir.  I will pray for your safety.
RspDflt=Thank you for your concern, Brother.  Good day.

[Chalice]
Say=Well met, sir!  How have things gone for you in the village?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Quite well, thank you.  And here?  How is the situation here?
NxtLn1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=Improving every day!  Fewer wounded come in on a day-to-day basis and more of our serious patients are surviving.  The good spirits will preserve us!
RspDflt=I'm sure they will, Brother Curley.

[three]
Say=Congratulations on your recent successes, officer!  The keep is awash in tales of your heroic deeds!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Really?  And I've been trying to keep a low profile...
nxtln1=three2

[three2]
Say=Ha!  Sarcasm!  I get it!  Let it be said that Brother Curley is not without a sense of humor!
RspDflt=I'll see to it immediately.  Farewell.

[chapter6]
Say=The power of the chalice has proven essential, but not even the cup of life will save us when the Ahoul come spilling over the walls! I fear for our sacred city.
RspDflt=We must keep our faith, brother. Farewell.

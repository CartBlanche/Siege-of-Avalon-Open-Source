[Soldier]
Say=Hey.  What's up, man?
RspTxt1=So what's your story, friend?
NxtLn1=Soldier1
RspTxt2=Anything new through the grapevine of Avalon's eyes and ears?
NxtLn2=Soldier2

[Soldier1]
Say=I was a serf in Elythria.  It was a tough life, but I had more to eat than I do here!  At least the ladies in the kitchen do what they can with what they're given.  I wish I could have a good rack of ribs...  Oh, I'm sorry, I must have been rambling again.

NxtLn1=Chalice1
RspTxt2=Any new whisperings in this part?

rspBack=chalice

[Chalice2]
Say=Yeah, I hear tell that the Fornaxans have developed a new spell.  No one agrees about what it does, though.  The only thing they do agree on is that it's "useful."  Great info, huh?

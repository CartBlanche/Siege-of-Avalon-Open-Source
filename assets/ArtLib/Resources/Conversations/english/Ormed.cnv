[Ormed]
Say=What's this?  You're new around here, eh?  Have you been stationed here, too?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=No.  I have personal business I'm attending to.
NxtLn1=Ormed1

[Ormed1]
Say=Right, then.  We don't see many new people around here.  Just the same men doing the same thing, day in and day out.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Hopefully, the situation will improve soon.
NxtLn1=Ormed2

[Ormed2]
Say=I don't set my hopes on that, sir.  Good spirits protect you.
RspDflt=Thank you.  You too.

[Chalice]
Say=Greetings, sir!  Made quite a bit of fuss, haven't you?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I didn't mean to.  I was just doing my duty as a soldier of Avalon.
NxtLn1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=That's all any of us ever do.  Some of us have duties that make us great.  Others are ordered to sit on their duff all day long.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=But every job is essential to our victory.
NxtLn1=Chalice2

[Chalice2]
Say=I suppose they are, sir.  Good day to you, then.
RspDflt=And to you, soldier.

[fourup]
Say=It's good to have you with us, sir.  You and your brother are a blessing!
RspDflt=Thank you, soldier!  Farewell.
RspTxt1=I will continue to try to exceed expectations, soldier.  Thank you for your kind words.

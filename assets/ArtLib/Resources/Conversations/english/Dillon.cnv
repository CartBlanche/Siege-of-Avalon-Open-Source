[Dillon]
Say=Greetings.  Is there something you need from me?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=No, soldier.  I'm just on my way through.
NxtLn1=Dillon1
RspTxt2=I'm new here and want to meet the people who I will be fighting beside.  Who are you and where are you from?
NxtLn2=Dillon2
RspTxt3=What's the word going around?
nxtln3=dillon3

[Dillon1]
Say=Very well, sir.  May the good spirits protect you.
RspDflt=And you.  Good day.

[Dillon2]
Say=I'm Dillon, sir.  I used to be a wizard's guard in Fornax, but my wizard sent me here to aid in the fighting.
RspDflt=A pleasure to meet you.  Good day.
rspBack=dillon

[Dillon3]
Say=I heard in the barracks that the wizards have come up with a powerful new weapon.  Do you know the truth of this?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm afraid I do not.  I'm sorry.
NxtLn1=Dillon4

[Dillon4]
Say=It's of no consequence, my lord.  Good day.
RspDflt=Good day.
rspBack=dillon

[Chalice]
Say=Hail, my lord!  How have you been these days?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Well, Dillon.  And you?
NxtLn1=Chalice1
RspTxt2=Fine.  What's the latest news?
NxtLn2=Chalice2

[Chalice1]
Say=Well enough, sir.
RspDflt=Excellent.  Good day.
rspBack=chalice

[Chalice2]
Say=They say you've had stunning victories over the Ahoul in the village!  Congratulations!
RspDflt=I'm not so sure they were stunning, but they were victories nonetheless.  Thank you.
rspBack=Chalice

[three]
Say=Hello, sir.  I haven't seen you in a while.  How have things been?  How is your brother doing?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=He's healing up in the infirmary.  He was in bad shape when I found him, and worse shape when he finally made it here.  He should recover in time to greet  King Vortigerm's forces.
nxtln1=three1

[three1]
Say=That's good to hear, sir.  We're glad to have you here..
RspDflt=Thank you, Dillon.  Farewell.
rspcnd1=all(stt(perception>19,charm>13));
RspTxt1=You seem preoccupied, soldier.  Is something on your mind?
nxtln1=three2
rspback=three

[three2]
Say=As a matter of fact,  I'm glad you asked, because there is.  It irritates me that everyone sees Fornax as a kingdom of mages and nothing but.  I happen to be from Fornax, and I do not appreciate the typecasting.  I don't know where this rumor has come from, but it's really doing a great job of alienating me from my fellows in the mess hall... and everywhere else.
adventure=ch3-513
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I understand why you are annoyed, soldier, but what can be done about it?  How do you fight such perpetuated ignorance?
nxtln1=three3

[three3]
Say=I just wish I knew who it was being perpetuated BY so I could give that person a good punch in the...  I mean, a good talking to.
RspDflt=none
rspcnd1=all(ttl(01Lahren));
RspTxt1=I know of at least one such person who I doubt you'll attempt to strike or speak with.
nxtln1=three4
RspTxt2=I haven't liked being called "kid" and "lad" and "son" and "child," the typecasting of a young, inexperienced inconsequential.  I'm just trying to prove them wrong.
nxtln2=three20

[three4]
Say=Oh, and who is that, if you don't mind telling me?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I certainly do not.  It was a mage by the name of Pell-
nxtln1=three5

[three5]
Say=Ah, yes.  [adopts a dry expression]  Insanity has been comparatively kind to her, but never mind that, what did she say to you as self-appointed ambassador of and speaker for all Fornaxans?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What is your problem with the woman?
nxtln1=three6

[three6]
Say=She's the most arrogant person from Fornax, which is funny, because she's only half Fornaxan, but that's irrelevant.  The real problem, as I've overheard so often, is that she refuses to follow the rules...  I couldn't pick up any more than "the rules," but...
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Spit it out, man!
nxtln1=three7
RspTxt2=Please continue..
nxtln2=three7

[three7]
Say=These wizards fervently believe that a human mind works on rules.  Magic bends those rules, and the mind must construct new rules.  For example, what if we were no longer held to the earth?  Wouldn't that redefine or destroy a good portion of what you perceived to be "real?"
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, but if the mind can construct new rules, as you've said...
nxtln1=three8
RspTxt2=I see what you're implying, but she seems stable enough to me.
nxtln2=three10

[three8]
Say=Not forever.  From what I've been able to gather, magical energy runs through the brain like water through an aqueduct.  While it is true that some minds possess... ah, larger aqueducts, each has its limit.  If the brain can't channel all the magical energy being brought into it, it runs freely, and without an active part of the human brain to control it, it finds the inactive parts...
adventure=ch3-514
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What happens then?
nxtln1=three9

[three9]
Say=They say the subconscious forms them.  I think it comes from dreams.  I don't have to tell you what horrors lurk there; we've all had nightmares as children.  You get me?
adventure=ch3-515
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Right.  What can I do to help her keep from overloading herself?
nxtln1=three10

[three10]
Say=Emotion is what triggers the channeling of such excessive magical energies.  [grins]  Don't anger her.  'Twould likely be a fatal mistake.  Likely her last excess has affected poor Lahren.  Now that I've answered your questions, could you answer mine?
RspDflt=none
adventure=ch3-516
RspTxt1=One more question, Dillon.  How did you come across all of this information?
nxtln1=three11

[three11]
Say=I could have sworn I mentioned to you in passing some time ago that I was once a wizard's guard for a time.  The wizard I worked for hosted a number of get-togethers, and he and his wizard-cronies spoke of many things.  Being a guard has its privileges; the simpler you look and act, the more they let you overhear.  So what did Pell say about Fornaxans?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=In addition to your story, she said that Fornaxans have magic in their blood, and something about being magical to her "very core," whatever that means.
nxtln1=three12

[three12]
Say=Oho, that's rich!  Have you ever heard anything so smarmy in your life?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I must confess that I have not.  Farewell, Dillon, I've matters to attend to.
nxtln1=three18
RspTxt2=The melodramatic tend to be just that, Dillon.  Farewell.
nxtln2=three18

[three18]
Say=I request that you keep silent about what I have said here.  Be evasive, lie if you need to, but do not mention me.
adventure=ch3-517
RspDflt=Not a problem, Dillon.  Farewell.
RspTxt1=And if I do?
nxtln1=three19

[three19]
Say=I'll deny everything.  [smirk]  Everyone but you, and a few select others, knows me as a very simple man, incapable of such thoughts, and moreover, uninterested in them.
RspDflt=A strong line of defense, Dillon.  Do not worry, your name will not be mentioned.  Farewell.

[three20]
Say=I suppose you're right about that, sir.  That's probably all I can hope to do; it's not like I can re-educate everyone at the same time.  It's just irritating, you get me?
RspDflt=I understand, soldier, but you'll thank yourself for biting your tongue.  Farewell.

[chapter6]
Say=I heard the monks say they were planning to move the infirmary. Why would they do that? That's going to take a lot of labor. With my long hours on watch I don't think I can help. The Sha'ahoul will attack again soon, and they want to move furniture! I wonder if Roth knows about this. Something is definitely happening behind the walls of Avalon!
RspDflt=Your guess is as good as mine...  Farewell.

[fourfive]
Say=It is good to see you again, sir.  I have heard that your brother insists upon being put to work again.  Such a trooper Lieutenant Corvus is!  It must run in the family!
RspDflt=Thank you for the compliment, Dillon.  I shall attempt to seek Corvus out.

[Olon]
Say=Greetings, soldier!
RspDflt=Good day to you.
RspTxt1=Hello.  I am new here, and I wish to meet the locals.  Who are you and where are you from?
NxtLn1=Olon1

[Olon1]
Say=I came from Nisos, where I'm known as Olon the Quick.  I had a bit of a reputation there as a thief and a master of sleight-of-hand.
RspDflt=Well met, Olon.
RspTxt1=Do you have any tricks you could show me?
NxtLn1=Tricks

[Tricks]
Say=Well, if your commanders don't have too much of a problem with it, I'd be happy to show you a thing or two.
RspDflt=Thank you.
script=player.addtitle(01thieftrained)

[NoPermission]
Say=Hello again.  What's new?
RspDflt=Nothing.  Good day.
RspTxt1=Do you have any more tricks?
NxtLn1=NoPermission1

[NoPermission1]
Say=Ha!  I have nothing more to show you.  What you need is practice.
RspDflt=Okay.  Thanks anyway.

[Permission]
Say=Welcome, lad!  How go things with you?
RspDflt=Pardon me, Olon, I must be on my way.
RspTxt1=Things are well, Olon.  I have gotten permission to search outside the citadel for my brother.  Mudam said you know a little about the terrain out there.
NxtLn1=Permission1

[Permission1]
Say=Going outside, are you?  Only a fool would risk his neck out there.  But I suppose if you insist upon going, I must tell you what I heard the other day.  Allegedly, there are tunnels running throughout the village underground.  I heard there is some kind of treasure down in those tunnels.  If you come across it, bring it here first.  I will give you top dollar for it!
RspDflt=Thanks for the tip.
RspTxt1=Do you remember anything else?
NxtLn1=Permission2

[Permission2]
Say=No, I don't.  If you want to know more, you should ask Friar Massus or Elarath the Wizard.  Both of them have been around since before the siege.  They'd probably know more than me.
script=player.addtitle(01Olon);
RspDflt=Thank you, Olon.

[NoChalice]
Say=So, the village hasn't killed you!  What can I do for you?
RspDflt=Nothing.  I apologize for disturbing you.
RspTxt1=Just sniffing out rumors.
nxtLn1=NoChalice1

[NoChalice1]
Say=Well, things aren't looking better for us on the inside.  Food is still scarce and the soldiers are greener than ever before.  I hope we can hold out.
RspDflt=I hope so, too.

[Chalice]
Say=It's the hero!  It is good to see you again!
RspDflt=And you as well, Olon.  Good spirits protect you.
RspTxt2=What a warm reception!  What's new around the Bailey?
NxtLn2=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=The clack of training swords has been getting louder ever since word of your exploits came here!  You're a lucky charm, that's for sure.
RspDflt=Thank you.  Good day.

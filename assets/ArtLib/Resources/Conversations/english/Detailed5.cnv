Default=Thank you.
Say1=
goto1=Soldier

[Soldier]
Say=I recognize the face of a countryman.  Greetings!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=You're Elythrian?  It's good to see a face from home.
NxtLn1=Soldier1

[Soldier1]
Say=There are others from all over the countryside here, but too many have seen nothing other than the rear end of their plow ox before now.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=They are mostly serfs then?
NxtLn1=Soldier2
RspTxt2=What part of Elythria are you from?
NxtLn2=Soldier3

[Soldier2]
Say=You know the ways of an Elythrian landholder.  Why would they risk their own necks when they can send their serfs?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Not all landholders are cowards.  If my father hadn't fallen sick, he would have joined my brother in the fight here years ago.
NxtLn1=Soldier4

[Soldier4]
Say=I didn't mean to offend.  As you might guess, we freemen have very jaded views of the landholders.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=And we landholders have very jaded views of freemen.
NxtLn1=Soldier5
RspTxt2=What would that opinion be?
NxtLn2=Soldier6

[Soldier5]
Say=I imagine you do.  Few enough freemen are worth anything.  My ancestors have been smiths for as far back as any can remember, however, so we aren't typical freemen.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Too many freeman are nothing more than rabble and beggars.  Better they were serfs than common trash.
NxtLn1=Soldier7

[Soldier7]
Say=I expect they would hold a different opinion.  Better to be poor and free, then well-fed and beholden to someone.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Perhaps, but remember that the commerce of our country depends on those serfs.
NxtLn1=Soldier8

[Soldier8]
Say=I'm sorry, friend, but I think we could carry on like this for hours.  A political argument isn't the wisest idea right now, don't you think?
RspDflt=True enough.  I apologize, and bid you good day.

[Soldier6]
Say=Since our ancestors were serfs at some point or another, most freemen despise landholders.  My family is a rare exception since we've always been free.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=That's rare indeed.  Elythrians are all bound to the feudal system in one way or another.  Even freemen depend on the landholders for business.
NxtLn1=Soldier9

[Soldier9]
Say=True, but the serfs would bring us business if they held their own lands, would they not?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Perhaps we should avoid this discussion.  If we're going to argue over this, I think we should so so in our spare time.
NxtLn1=Soldier10

[Soldier10]
Say=Point taken.  Good day to you.
RspDflt=Good day.

[Soldier3]
Say=My family has a shop in Thymos.  We've been smiths for so long that no one in my family remembers us doing anything else.  And you?  Where in Elythria are you from?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=My father has lands along the Nisosan border.  Our serfs mostly raise grains and pigs.
NxtLn1=Soldier11

[Soldier11]
Say=So, you've already gotten military training then.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I learned a few things when I was growing up.
NxtLn1=Soldier12
RspTxt2=Of course.  I've been fighting since I was a baby.
nxtln2=soldier13

[Soldier12]
Say=Then you should do fine here in Avalon.  Most of the soldiers here knew nothing of warfare when they came.  We've still managed to hold Ahoul though.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I only hope to be of use here.
NxtLn1=Soldier14

[Soldier14]
Say=You will be.  Good day.
RspDflt=And to you.

[Soldier13]
Say=Is that right?  You'll find that boasting will get you in trouble around here.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Who says I am boasting?
NxtLn1=Soldier15

[Soldier15]
Say=I do.  I know an untried soldier when I see one.  I'd invite you to the sparring field, but I wouldn't want to embarrass the Elythrian lord too badly.  Go dance with an Ahoul, and then perhaps we'll see what you know.
RspDflt=I won't forget your offer.

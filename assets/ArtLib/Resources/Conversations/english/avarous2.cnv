Say=So, you think you're ready for some serious soldiering?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I feel confident in my abilities, sir.

[Avarous2]
Say=As you say, soldier.  I'll report your skill level to the commanders and they will assign you to your duties.  Dismissed.

[Avarous3]
Say=You're past the time when you'd need training around here!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Actually, I just came for a good rumor.
nxtln1=Avarous4

[Avarous4]
Say=Times are too hard for there to be anything on the training grounds but training.  One day, perhaps we can ease up a bit and let the soldiers relax, but today is not that day.
RspDflt=I understand.  Good day, Captain.

[Avarous5]
Say=What's an excellent soldier like you doing down on the training grounds?  Isn't there something more important for you to be attending to?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I'm just taking a moment to catch my breath, Captain.  What's new around here?
nxtln1=Avarous6

[Avarous6]
Say=Your heroism has inspired the trainees; they're all working harder than ever before.  I suspect these new soldiers will be a match for even the best of the Sha'ahoul!
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=That's excellent news, Captain!
nxtln1=Avarous7

[Avarous7]
Say=Good spirits protect you.
RspDflt=And you.

[Avarous8]
Say=I have reported your skill level to the commanders; they will assign you soon.  Dismissed.
RspDflt=Yes, sir.

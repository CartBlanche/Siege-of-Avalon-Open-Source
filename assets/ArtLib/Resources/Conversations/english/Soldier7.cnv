[Soldier]
Say=Whatcha need?
RspTxt1=Where are you from?
NxtLn1=Soldier1
RspTxt2=Heard any good rumors?
NxtLn2=Soldier2

[Soldier1]
Say=My home is in Cathea.  Well, it was.  I raised cattle there, that is, until I was conscripted to fight here.  Don't laugh.  Raising cattle isn't all that impressive a job, but even a mad cow is nowhere near as vicious as an Ahoul raider.

[Soldier2]
Say=I heard King Vortigerm of Taberland is coming with every able-bodied man in his kingdom.  The soldiers of Taberland have proven themselves before in battle.  Their arrival will save us.  I hope they bring food with them.

[Chalice1]
Say=I was born on the high plains of Cathea.  I raised cattle there, that is, until I was conscripted to fight here.  If I was given a horse, I would ride better than any Ahoul savage!

[Chalice2]
Say=Rumor has it that there is a new officer with the Elythrians who will turn the tides of this war.  They say he has been touched by the gods!

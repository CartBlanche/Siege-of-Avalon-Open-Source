[Cardew1]
Say=We were all upset to hear about your brother.  He saved my neck more than once.
RspDflt=I appreciate the sentiment.
RspTxt1=Thank you.  Where are you from, sir?
Nxtln1=Cardew2

[Cardew2]
Say=I'm from Aratoy, lad.  I was the leader of a nomadic band there.  We all came to here to fight the Ahoul -- we figured it would be a ferocious and bloodthirsty battle, and whatever could be finer than that?
RspDflt=I don't know, sir, but may the spirits protect you and your men.

[Cardew3]
Say=Greetings, lad.  I hope everything goes well.
RspDflt=It does, my lord.

[Cardew4]
Say=The hero comes home at last!  Hearing of your feats has encouraged us all!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Thank you, sir.  Is there anything new happening?
NxtLn1=Cardew5

[Cardew5]
Say=Well, I can't really tell you of the big stuff.  Know this, though: it won't be long until a proper meal!
RspDflt=That's excellent news, indeed!  Good day to you, sir!

[chapter6]
Say=I tire of this constant debate and drudgery! I wish Roth would just sent us to battle now, before we all starve to death!
RspDflt=You get your chance, I'm sure. Farewell.

[threeup]
Say=I heard Anora used merscwog in her last dish!  How exotic!
RspDflt=Perhaps I should try her latest dish, then.  Farewell.

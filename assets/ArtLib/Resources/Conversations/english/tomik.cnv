[Brun]
Say=Beyond those bars lies the South Gate, boy, and beyond that hungry Ahoul are waiting to steal your life.  Are you sure you have enough experience to walk to South Gate?  It's no place for amateurs.

RspDflt=Keep heart, soldier.  We will triumph.
rspBack=Brun

[Brun3]

[chalice2]
Say=The Ahoul supposedly got more reinforcements.  It won't make a difference, though.  Once King Vortigerm arrives at the helm of his great army, they won't stand a chance!
RspDflt=I agree.  Pardon me; I've duties to attend to.
rspBack=chalice

[three]
Say=Be careful if you decide to go back out there...  The Ahoul are up to something.  I can smell it in the air.  [sniff]

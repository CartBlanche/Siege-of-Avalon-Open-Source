[Cheney3]
Say=There's talk of abandoning Avalon.  Nobody in the Keep would say such a thing, but I've heard whisper of it in the Baileys.  I hope we don't give up so easily.
RspDflt=As do I.
rspBack=cheney1

[Cheney4]
Say=Hello, sir.  How can I be of aid to you?
RspTxt1=Heard any rumors?
RspDflt=Good day.
NxtLn1=cheney5

[cheney5]
Say=I have heard that the army is getting more and more ambitious. There is talk of a night raid and perhaps even a large offensive.  Keep your ears open.  There may be some fighting before too long.
RspDflt=I'm ready for a fight.

Say=Hello, sir.  To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?
RspDflt=Pardon me, soldier.  I was just making my way through.

RspTxt1=You can ditch the sweetness, soldier; I'm not impressed.
nxtln1=three1
rspcnd2=all(stt(perception<25));
RspTxt2=Nothing special, just keeping my ears open.

[three1]
Say=...Was it that obvious?
RspDflt=none
rspcnd1=all(ttl(!hunter));
RspTxt1=No, it was not, but I am an unusually perceptive person.  Tell me, have you heard anything interesting lately?
nxtln1=three2
rspcnd2=all(ttl(hunter));
RspTxt2=No, it was not, but I've had some scout training.  Tell me, have you heard anything interesting lately?
nxtln2=three2

[three2]
Say=Heard?  Nah, but I seen something kinda funny.  I sometimes watch the camps when I'm not on duty, and the Sha'ahoul have been doing something, to be sure, they've been doing something, yup.  During the night I can see them bustling about.  Too far away to make anything out but a bunch of torches and shadows.

[Mikel]
Say=You there!  Don't dawdle about!  There are soldiers with business around and you shouldn't be in their way!
RspDflt=I'm sorry.
RspTxt1=Where are you from?
NxtLn1=Mikel1
RspTxt2=What's the latest word from around here?
NxtLn2=Mikel2

[Mikel1]
Say=I'm from Cathea.  I didn't always used to be a lowly guard!  I was a Cathean rider before I got kicked out!
RspDflt=Perhaps you will rise to that position again.
rspBack=Mikel

[Mikel2]
Say=I don't have time to gossip with you!  I don't care who your brother is, I have important things to attend to!
RspDflt=Sorry to bother you.
rspBack=Mikel

[chalice]
Say=You think that when you see some combat you can go about bothering soldiers with real soldiering to see to?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Pardon me.
NxtLn1=chalice1
RspTxt2=What's the news?
NxtLn2=chalice2

[chalice1]
Say=Perhaps I was a bit sharp with you.  I apologize for my sharpness.  Good day to you, sir.
RspDflt=Good day.
rspBack=chalice

[chalice2]
Say=Just that the Ahoul have started running away.  Their numbers may not look like they're different.  But let me assure you, they are afraid now!
RspDflt=I certainly hope so.  Farewell.
rspBack=chalice

[chapter6]
Say=Good day to you, %playername%.  Look, I realize I've been a bit short with you.  Please accept my swordarm when we face the Sha'ahoul in battle.
RspDflt=It is an honor, Mikel, and likewise.  Hold to your faith and skill, brother.

[threeup]
Say=I wish I were back in Cathea.  These cold walls are chilling my heart.  I miss my horse.
RspDflt=I'll leave you be, soldier.

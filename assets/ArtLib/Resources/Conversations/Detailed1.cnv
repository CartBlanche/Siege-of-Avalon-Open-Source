[Soldier]
Say=Hello there.  What can I do for you?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I've just arrived in Avalon and was just looking around.
NxtLn1=Soldier1

[Soldier1]
Say=Take a close look, lad!  There isn't much more to Avalon than this!  If we were in Aratoy, then there would be something to look at.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Aren't you glad to be here fighting the Ahoul?
NxtLn1=Soldier2
RspTxt2=Are you from Aratoy?
NxtLn2=Soldier3

[Soldier2]
Say=You are new, aren't you?  Boy, when you've been manning the wall for as long as I have, the glory of defending the seven kingdoms fades.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=If we don't do it though, then who will?
NxtLn1=Soldier4

[Soldier4]
Say=I'm not saying I won't do my job.  I'm just saying I'd rather be hunting in my homeland, that's all.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Are you much of a hunter?
NxtLn1=Soldier5
RspTxt2=As would I, but I'm proud to be here.
NxtLn2=Soldier6

[Soldier5]
Say=There are few that are better, even among Aratoyans!  I made a heart shot with my bow from four hundred paces once.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=You must be mistaken.  No man could make a shot like that...
NxtLn1=Soldier7

[Soldier7]
Say=Doubt me if you will.  But you'll find that most Aratoyans can make that shot.  There are few that could do even better.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=If you say so.  Take care.
NxtLn1=Soldier8

[Soldier8]
Say=You too, lad.  We hate to see green soldiers get gutted within the first week!
RspDflt=Good day.

[Soldier6]
Say=Proud?  You must be nobly born.  Only a noble's son would find pride in warfare.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Why do you say that?
NxtLn1=Soldier9

[Soldier9]
Say=Because the peasant's children always die.  Nobles usually manage to avoid injury.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Are you calling nobles cowards?
NxtLn1=Soldier10

[Soldier10]
Say=No.  I'm just saying arrows have a way of missing the nobly born.  Swords seem to slide off their armor and their opponents never seem to make that killing blow.  Strange, don't you think?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'll have you know that my father was a great warrior who took many injuries.  My brother, Corvus, didn't seem to find the luck you speak of.  He has a scar on his neck.
NxtLn1=Soldier11

[Soldier11]
Say=You're Corvus' brother?  I'm sorry, my lord.  I didn't know you were related to him.  Your brother is a fine warrior, if a little reckless.  He always seems to be in the thickest of the fighting.
RspDflt=I accept your apology.  I'm afraid I must depart.  Good day to you.

[Soldier3]
Say=Of course!  There is nowhere else on this planet like it.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I've always wondered what Aratoy is like.
NxtLn1=Soldier12

[Soldier12]
Say=If you can imagine trees that embrace you and care for you like your own mother would...
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Are you from Perigwin?
NxtLn1=Soldier13

[Soldier13]
Say=No true Aratoyan would live in a city.  My family and I lived in the deep northern forests.  Everything a person could ever need is provided for by the woods.  We have never wanted for anything.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Who do you answer to?  Isn't there some kind of government?
NxtLn1=Soldier14
RspTxt2=My father taught me something of the forests in Elythria.  I suspect I'm almost as adept as an Aratoyan in woodslore.
NxtLn2=Soldier15

[Soldier14]
Say=We answered to the clanmother.  The clanmother is always the eldest woman in the family.  My aunt was the clanmother for us.  We have a king in Aratoy and there are other minor offices beneath that, but few recognize the king as having any power.  He plays mostly a diplomatic role.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=He's just a figure for the other kingdoms to relate to then?
NxtLn1=Soldier16

[Soldier16]
Say=You have the way of it.  No one's really sure how the king comes to power and few really care.  A good clanmother lives far better than any king in Aratoy.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=What queer politics your country has.
NxtLn1=Soldier17

[Soldier17]
Say=Some would think so.  After living with it all of my life, I can't imagine having to pay homage to a king of landowner.  You easterners are far stranger than we Aratoyans.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Perhaps you are right.  As you say though, I have always lived with these ways.  They seem natural to me.
NxtLn1=Soldier18
RspTxt2=Those that are east of us are even stranger though.
NxtLn2=Soldier19

[Soldier18]
Say=True.  Perhaps we can talk more of our countries over a drink when the siege is lifted.
RspDflt=I hope so.  Good day to you.

[Soldier19]
Say=Indeed!  Blasted Ahoul with their heathen religion!
RspDflt=May we have the strength to destroy them.

[Soldier15]
Say=A bold statement!  An Aratoyan can sneak up on you and remove your underclothes without you even noticing!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Is that so?  Perhaps I should be more careful of my possessions around Aratoyans then.
NxtLn1=Soldier20

[Soldier20]
Say=Sneaky we may be, sir.  But we are not thieves.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I was only jesting, friend.  Anyone that fights the Ahoul is my brother and I would trust them with my life.
NxtLn1=Soldier21

[Soldier21]
Say=An idealistic sentiment.  For all of our sake, I hope you are right.
RspDflt=Good luck to you.

[chapter6]
Say=Hail, sir. Did you need my help?
RspDflt=Not at the moment. Farewell.

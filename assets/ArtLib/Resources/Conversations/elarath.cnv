RspDflt=Good day to you, wizard.
rspBack=Elarath1

[Elarath3]
Say=I am Elarath, and, as you can see, this is my laboratory, where I am doing research on the ancient ruins that lie beneath the village.  I also serve as an advisor to Sir Roth and his council and, when I can, I teach aspiring mages to better control the forces around them.

[training]
Say=I can teach almost anyone to be a sorcerer!  Come closer and we shall begin... [After several hours of instruction] ...very good.  You have at least some aptitude for magic.

[Flame]
Say=Ah, the Flame spell -- it's a classic in this profession.  This spell does a moderate amount of damage to your target.  The stronger you are in mysticism, the more damage the spell inflicts and the faster the ball of flame will travel.  Does this sound like something you would like to know how to cast?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, I think it does.
script1=player.addtitle(Flame);player.setprop(trainingpoints=-2);
nxtLn1=TrainTitles
RspTxt2=Perhaps later.  What else could you teach me?
nxtLn2=TrainTitles

[Frost]
Say=Like Flame, Frost does a moderate amount of damage to a target.  Unlike Flame, which can miss if your victim has sharp enough reflexes, Frost seeks out its target.  The stronger you are in magic, the more damage you can cause and the more likely Frost will be able to accurately find its target, no matter how they might flee or where they might hide.  Does this sound like something you would like to know how to cast?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, I think it does.
script1=player.addtitle(Frost);player.setprop(trainingpoints=-2);
nxtLn1=TrainTitles
RspTxt2=Perhaps later.  What else could you teach me?
nxtLn2=TrainTitles

[Heal]
Say=If you ever get wounded in combat -- and it's a depressingly regular occurrence, I'm afraid -- you will have two choices: wrap a dirty bandage around the wound and hope the bleeding ceases or use the Heal spell and be instantly whole.  Not much of a choice, I should think.  Does this sound like something you would like to know how to cast?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, I think it does.
script1=player.addtitle(Heal);player.setprop(trainingpoints=-1);
nxtLn1=TrainTitles
RspTxt2=Perhaps later.  What else could you teach me?
nxtLn2=TrainTitles

[Hold]
Say=A fairly useful spell, Hold will immobilize an opponent for a short length of time.  The stronger you are in the art, the longer your opponent will not be able to move -- or fight back, if you catch my meaning.  Does this sound like something you would like to know how to cast?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, I think it does.
script1=player.addtitle(Hold);player.setprop(trainingpoints=-1);
nxtLn1=TrainTitles
RspTxt2=Perhaps later.  What else could you teach me?
nxtLn2=TrainTitles

[training1]
Say=Back for more!  Magic is addictive, isn't it?  Feel free to look around.
RspDflt=Good day to you, sir wizard.
rspcnd1=All(ttl(01trainedwizard):stt(trainingpoints>1));
RspTxt1=I was wondering if you might have the time to train me in some of those advanced techniques you mentioned.

RspCnd2=all(ttl(01Lahren,!01ElarathPell));
RspTxt2=Know you, sir wizard, of the mage Pellandrian?
nxtLn2=Pell1

[training2]
Say=So, you've come back to see the old wizard, eh?  How can I help you, lad?
RspDflt=Pardon me for disturbing you, learned one.
rspcnd1=all(ttl(!ela082001));
RspTxt1=I'm going on a mission to the village soon.  I was told by Olon the, uh, "merchant" that you knew something of the village.

RspTxt4=Know you, sir wizard, of the mage Pellandrian?
nxtLn4=Pell1

[permission1]
Say=Let's see...  The village is built on the ruins of an ancient city.  When we first arrived, we took what stone we needed to build Avalon from the ruins.  Now, they are an elaborate, underground network that is virtually abandoned.  However, I wouldn't be surprised to learn that they are currently inhabited by numerous animals or perhaps even more exotic creatures.

RspTxt1=Thank you for the information.
NxtLn1=permission2
RspTxt2=Is that all you remember?

[permission2]
Say=Don't mention it, lad!  Good luck on the outside.
RspDflt=I'll see you soon, Elarath.
rspBack=permission1

[permission3]
Say=No, I'm pretty certain that -- Oh, wait!  There is something else.  I've actually been trying to recover a valuable artifact from the village for some time now.  It's an amulet that is needed in the research I'm doing on a certain portal.  Elazar had the amulet last, but it was lost when he abandoned his tower.  The tower itself is magically sealed, but the amulet is believed to have been lost when the cart carrying much of Elazar's research broke an axle and spilled its contents on the ground while passing through the village.  The amulet should still be on the ground near the broken cart.
Adventure=ch1-73;
AddQuest=ch1-23;
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I will see what I can do.
NxtLn1=permission5

[permission5]
Say=Thank you for your kindness, lad!  With the amulet, hopefully I will be able to finally open the portal.  I will await your return!
RspDflt=I'll see you soon, Elarath.

RspTxt9=Well enough.  Know you, sir wizard, of the mage Pellandrian?
nxtLn9=Pell1

[ChaliceFalseAmulet]
Say=Very well, indeed!  With these two items among us, the siege will surely turn in our favor!  No, wait...  This is not Elazar's amulet.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What?  Are you certain?
nxtLn1=FalseAmulet1

[FalseAmulet]
Say=Ah, let me see, let me see!  No...  No, this isn't it.  It's a nice piece to be sure, but this is not Elazar's amulet.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Are you certain?
nxtLn1=FalseAmulet1

[FalseAmulet1]
Say=Yes, lad, I'm certain.  Do you really think I wouldn't remember what a powerful magical amulet looks like?  It's odd, though -- I don't recognize this design.  Most unusual.  Now, where did I put that reference compendium...
RspDflt=none

RspTxt1=Ah...  Elarath?
nxtLn1=FalseAmulet2

[FalseAmulet2]

RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Would you please tell me, then, what Elazar's amulet looks like?
nxtLn1=FalseAmulet3

[FalseAmulet3]
Say=Elazar's...?  Go ask him.  It was his amulet, after all.  He's in the upper level of the South Gate.  Spirits, where did I put...?
Adventure=ch1-75;
AddQuest=ch1-24;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I see.  I will do my best, sir wizard.
nxtLn1=FalseAmulet4

[FalseAmulet4]
Say=Yes, yes.  I thank you for your efforts, but be off with you now!
RspDflt=Goodbye.

[villageNews1]
Say=Very little changes in a citadel under siege.  The list of dead and dying soldiers grows a little longer and the hunger gnawing away at every belly grows a little stronger.
RspTxt1=We all pray that the tide turns in our favor soon.
NxtLn1=villageNews2
RspDflt=None

[villageNews2]
Say=That would be a welcome change.  Will you be returning to the village soon?
RspTxt1=No.  I don't think I yet have the skills that an expedition outside of Avalon demands.
NxtLn1=villageNews3
RspTxt2=Soon enough.  I will continue looking for your amulet.
NxtLn2=villageNews4

RspDflt=Thank you, Elarath.  May the good spirits protect you.

[villageChalice]
Say=The Chalice of Life?  That's a powerful artifact, indeed!  With it back among us, the soldiers will surely take heart again!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=That's what Friar Massus says.  I pray he is right.
NxtLn1=villageChalice1

[villageChalice1]
Say=Friar Massus knows what he's about.  Just wait and see.  Will you be continuing the search for the amulet?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Not right now.  I need to rest a bit from the fighting.
NxtLn1=villageChalice2
RspTxt2=Yes.  I won't give up until I've returned it to your hands.
NxtLn2=villageChalice3

[villageChalice2]
Say=Absolutely!  I'm sure the Chalice wasn't easy to recover.  Let me know how you're doing.
RspDflt=I will.  Good day, Elarath.

RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, I know.  I was wondering what you might know of her.
nxtLn1=Pell2

I will say that I'm surprised my fellow Fornaxans let her leave the country.  Or maybe it was they couldn't keep her in!
RspDflt=none

Following his death, we've had reason to suspect that something unnatural has occured to his spirit.  If by any chance you can find out what has happened, the mages of Avalon would be very grateful.  If there is a problem, solving it would possibly elevate you enough to become peers with the finer mages of the realm.
adventure=ch5-47;
RspDflt=I have already encountered him, and I am doing what I can to help him.  Farewell.
rspback=elarafive



[elarafive1]
Say=My studies have taken most of my time.  However, my assistant, Sherard, has learned quite a bit since you last talked to him; I am sure he now has the capability to teach the spells and techniques I offered you.  Besides...  It would help him at last feel competent.  He wants very much to help..
adventure=ch5-502;
RspDflt=Agreed, Elarath; I shall ask him about it, then.  Farewell.
rspback=elarafive

[elarafive2]
Say=Ah, Elazar and I are collaborating on the portal I may have mentioned to you earlier.  Have you spoken to him recently?  I believe he has a request for you.  Yes, I know he's hardly charismatic, but it's his request to make.  I think he's softened quite a bit since he started working on the portal...  Harrumph!  I'm sure you don't have time for my old man's prattle now!  Go see Elazar; he doubtless will know when you arrive.
adventure=ch5-503;
script=player.addtitle(05rath2zar);
RspDflt=Very well.  Farewell, wise one; I shall return.

[elarafive3]
Say=Hmm, while it's true that Elazar and I have been working on the portal, I'm sure he's told you that our "strides" have come up a bit shorter than they must.  Our belief is that the enchantment on his ring of Form Protection, which is largely used to protect one against polymorphing, can be transferred to the portal itself to protect anything passing through it.  If it doesn't work, we'll simply try something else.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I understand, Elarath.  Have you done such "enchantment transference" before?
nxtln1=elarafive4
RspTxt2=Then I shall return with the ring as soon as possible, Elarath.
nxtln2=elarafive6
rspcnd3=all(ttl(05defenseson,!05elara01));
RspTxt3=What's preventing me from getting this ring are the defenses Elazar had sworn were inactive.  There are wraiths and worse parading his tower!  Do you know anything about his defenses, or how to defeat them?
script3=addtitle(05elara01);
nxtln3=elarafive7

[elarafive4]
Say=Yes, in fact, but it doesn't always work how we wish it would...  Magic is an imaginative force, you see, and sometimes it thinks of things that we don't.  We're all very amused afterwards; that is, of course, if no one gets hurt.  At least in this case we can be sure that it won't hurt a soul before it is employed.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Elazar had suggested rats...
nxtln1=elarafive5
RspTxt2=Do not worry, wise one.  I will bring the ring to you in short order.
nxtln2=elarafive6

[elarafive5]
Say=Far too stringy...  Eh?  Oh, yes, for testing the portal, of course.  Not a bad idea, although it may take a sweet voice to keep the guards from pursuing one of their only sources of sport, heh...
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Thank you for the information, Elarath.  I will visit you again once I possess the ring.
nxtln1=elarafive6

[elarafive6]
Say=Thank you, %playername%, we'll try to make your efforts more fruitful than mere learning on our part.  Oh, and one tidbit you might find interesting; one of the Magistrates of the Council of Fornax has arrived recently.  His name is Khaele, and I have had dealings with him before.  You can expect no trouble from him, but the fact that he is here signals that he wants something.  He is still located in one of the tents in the Inner Bailey.
adventure=ch5-546;
RspDflt=Do not worry, wise one; I have little doubt that you will discover something that will help us.  Farewell.

[elarafive7]
Say=It doesn't surprise me that his defense, as it were, would have to do with the faction of Creation.  I haven't even the weakest idea how he got a summoning or creation spell to work on a contingent; he must have had an epiphany.  I don't think it can last forever, if that's any consolation, and I think you can handle yourself.
adventure=ch5-504;
RspDflt=I suppose I shall simply have to ensure that all of them have been destroyed.  Thank you, and farewell, Elarath.

[elagetring]
Say=I suppose you will be answering to me from now on, %playername%, for Sherard tells me that Elazar has taken ill.  He has probably been fretting too much over our work.  It is good for him to rest, now; he never took the time to master the more complicated enchantments, and I will only need Sherard's help to complete what I am doing.
adventure=ch5-505;ch5-544;
RspDflt=none
rspcnd1=all(ttl(!05elara01));
RspTxt1=Ah.  I wished to mention to him that the "defenses" that he thought had not been activated accosted me upon my arrival.  I doubt wraiths are native to this region.
nxtln1=elagetring2
RspTxt2=I see.  Since you are the one who will be doing the work, I shall leave the ring in your possession to do with as you must.

[elagetring2]
Say=Wraiths?  No, they aren't native to this area, and yes, those minions were likely the "defenses" he told you about.  If you give me the ring, I may begin, and I wish to do so as soon as possible.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Of course, Elarath.  I wish you good luck in your endeavor.

AddQuest=ch5-504;
script=player.addtitle(05ringdone);
RspDflt=No, Elarath.  I shall check on Pell presently.

[portalready]

script=player.addtitle(portalactive);
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=That's good news indeed, Elarath, because I have a request to make of you...
nxtln1=portalready2
RspTxt2=Wonderful!  Can it take me to the Astral Plane?
nxtln2=portalready3

[portalready2]
Say=Oh, and what might that be?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Pell has informed me that Sha'men are summoning the spirits of some of our fellows to the Astral Plane.  She does not know exactly what these Sha'men are doing, but fears the worst.
nxtln1=portalready4

[portalready3]
Say=Wh-  Whatever would you need to go to the Astral Plane for?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Pell has informed me that Sha'men are summoning the spirits of some of our fellows to the Astral Plane, where they have projected themselves.  She does not know exactly what these Sha'men are doing, but fears the worst.
nxtln1=portalready4

[portalready4]
Say=Now that I think of it, she explained that she was feeling ill some time ago.  I'm not surprised that she looked into it the way she did; after all, she's never been a sickly thing.  So you need to go to the Astral Plane, do you?  I believe the portal was originally intended to transport its users to the Astral Plane, so if I don't try to plot its exit point, hmm, you should arrive close to where you wish to go.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Should?  Are you sure of this?
nxtln1=portalready5

[portalready5]
Say=Oh, don't worry.  I know that wherever the portal goes is hospitable to life, and the carvings that haven't worn off suggest it is indeed the Astral Plane.  The destination was fixed when the portal was created, so I cannot guarantee that it will deposit you close to where you need to be.
adventure=ch5-507;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Is there anything I should remember during my travels?
nxtln1=portalready6

[portalready6]
Say=I'm afraid I have little in the way of advice for you on your journey because very little is known about astral travel.  It is disappointing that the Sha'ahoul have managed to discover it first.  Except...
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, Elarath?  What has occurred to you?
nxtln1=portalready7

[portalready7]
Say=Yes, this is indeed important, and I'm glad you thought to ask.  Magic should work with very little hindrance on the Astral Planes, but I seriously doubt that unenchanted weapons will do any damage to the projected images of the Sha'men you will encounter.  If you doubt your casting abilities, you will need to procure such a weapon if you do not already have one.  I'm sure one of the blacksmiths, er, Tepest, I think, or...  Lucas?  Lufkin?  One should have such a sword.
Script=journalentry(chpt5-04);showmessage(Your journal has been updated,200);
adventure=ch5-508;ch5-547;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Thank you for the advice, Elarath.
nxtln1=portalready8a

[portalready8a]
Say=Before I forget, I must also teach you a spell that will aid you tremendously in the Astral Plane.  It is a minor protective spell, one that can be taught quite easily to one with your advancing magical skill.  It protects against magical effects, which are likely to be the only offense employed against you while you travel the Astral Nexus.
RspDflt=none
script=player.addtitle(Protection From Magic);
RspTxt1=Thank you, Elarath.  Is there anything else I should know before I embark?
nxtln1=portalready8

[portalready8]
Say=Not that I can recall.  The portal is activated and I shall keep a close watch on it so that it stays open for you...  That, and to ensure that nothing else comes through.  I'm not sure the Sha'men's projected selves could cross the threshold, but their spells, and anything they decide to summon, could quite conceivably do so.  Good luck, %playername%.
adventure=ch5-509;
RspDflt=Thank you, Elarath.  I shall see you soon.

[tokenfive]
Say=Yes, and I must admit that this is an interesting enchantment, indeed.  Again, most of what the Sha'men do is somewhat of a mystery to us.  They seem to have come across some of the same magics, but by different means, so that understanding their enchantments is almost like working on an ancient portal!
adventure=ch5-510;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What fate will befall Queen Nanesi if this object is merely destroyed?
nxtln1=tokenfive2

[tokenfive2]
Say=It's possible that her spirit could get trapped, or...  Perhaps destroyed, but we will not attempt anything until some more divination can be performed.  It may just be decided that nothing is to be done to it for fear of risking her life.  Pell tells me that this type of magic is closely linked to that of the lich stone, although definitely different, as I have mentioned.  If only good Felious were still with us...
adventure=ch5-511;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Actually, Elarath, he might still be able to help.
nxtln1=tokenfive3

[tokenfive3]
Say=What say you?  How?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I encountered his spirit on the Astral Plane.  He is trapped there for the present, and it was only with his help that I was able to do what was necessary to clean the Sha'man taint from the Astral Nexus.
nxtln1=tokenfive4

[tokenfive4]
Say=Ah.  How appropriate for him that he should find some form of life after death.  Not that I find his predicament amusing, %playername%, but I cannot miss the irony of it.  I am sure that some part of Felious thinks it a tad amusing... though probably just a tad.  We shall need to seek his advice on this matter, for he certainly must know a technique, or an incantation, that would assist us.
AddQuest=ch5-500;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Very well, Elarath, I shall return once Felious has advised me.
nxtln1=tokenfive5
RspTxt2=May I ask a few questions before I depart to confer with Felious?
nxtln2=tokenfive6

[tokenfive5]
Say=And I shall stand watch as before.  Good speed, %playername%.
script=player.addtitle(05askfelious);
RspDflt=Thank you, Elarath, and farewell.

[tokenfive6]
Say=Certainly, %playername%!  What is your concern?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Pell had said that divination was more or less her "specialty."  What do you think?
nxtln1=tokenfive7
RspTxt2=What will happen to Queen Nanesi if we do nothing?
nxtln2=tokenfive8
rspcnd3=all(ttl(05nesisnap));
RspTxt3=Why doesn't the Queen have any recollection of what has happened to her?
nxtln3=tokinfive9

[tokenfive7]
Say=I believe divination is one of her major studies...  [laughing softly] ...and as you can imagine, one with divinitive skills knows very much indeed!  Perhaps more than she should; the details of why the Council of Fornax requests her presence, or why she refuses to acknowledge the Council's authority, are unknown.
adventure=ch5-512;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Very well, Elarath.  I shall return once Felious has advised me.
nxtln1=tokenfive5
rspback=tokenfive6

[tokenfive8]
Say=I'd imagine she'll stay in the same state she's currently in, which is probably a pretty unsettled one, despite the appearance she may project.  Having one's spirit influenced in such a condition...  [He shakes his head slowly.]  I doubt her ethereal self really needs to be on one of the material planes, so we shall of course do what we can.  Be sure to speak with me again.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Very well, Elarath.  I shall return once Felious has advised me.
nxtln1=tokenfive5
rspback=tokenfive6

[tokinfive9]
Say=You have spoken to her?  Pell has told me that they were appearing as her protectors on the Astral Plane, and I don't think that speaking to her is a good idea.  She likely doesn't even know what's happened.  Human minds can do strange things.
adventure=ch5-513;

RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=There's no reason to overreact, Elarath, certainly you don't think I'm a threat...
nxtln1=upgrader2

[upgrader2]
Say=What?  Whatever are you...  [He blinks, throws back his head and laughs in a flurry of white.]  No, no, %playername%!  You are to be promoted!  Your strength in the mystical arts is already quite impressive, and with this latest feat, you've proven yourself worthy of the title of a Wizard.

RspTxt1=I am honored, Elarath.  Is there anything I must do to retain this new status?
nxtln1=upgrader3

[upgrader3]
Say=Nothing that you haven't done already, %playername%.  You are overdue for this privilege, which would have been given to you much earlier had you been given years of formal training.  However, I cannot deny that you exceed many mages in the application of your powers.
RspDflt=none

RspTxt2=No rituals, no tattoos or secret handshakes?

[upgrader4]
Say=Keep to the same code of conduct you've always followed; it has served you and our cause well.  Oh!  And before I forget, although we cannot give you the celebration one would take part in at the Academy, I do have a gift for you to mark this occasion.  I hope you will find this staff useful; it is, after all, a more appropriate weapon for a mage than some rusty blade.

[upgrader5]
Say=Ha!  No, nothing of the sort, although had you been a student at the Academy, there would have been a celebration to mark the occasion.  To make up for the lack of fanfare and celebration, I have a gift for you to mark this occasion.  I hope that you will find this staff useful; it is, after all, a more appropriate weapon for a mage than some rusty blade.
script=player.additem(MageStaff1);
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Thank you for this honor, Elarath.  Words alone cannot express my gratitude.
nxtln1=upgrader6

[upgrader6]
Say=Nonsense!  It is your due, %playername%, and I'm sure the others at the Academy would agree with me.  Good luck to you.
RspDflt=Thank you again, Elarath, and farewell for now.

[endofch5]
Say=I believe you've done just about all of it once again, %playername%.  I suggest that you get some rest.  Perhaps one of our commanders has an assignment for you.  I do not know, for as you know I have been quite busy as of late.  I believe I shall get some rest myself, soon...
RspDflt=I believe I shall as well, Elarath.  Thank you.

[finishjar]
Say=We must finish the business with the Queen, %playername%, but other than that, I'd say that we've put in a good few days' work, wouldn't you?  [smiles toothily]
RspDflt=Indeed we have, wise one.  I shall endeavor to finish this quest, and will speak to you when it is finished.  Farewell.

[morbidicon]
Say=Hmm, yes, indeed...  I've not had much use for that particular volume.  [He moves to the bookcase with surprising grace, and returns with an undamaged, dark grey book, which opens with a protracted crackling sound.]  I believe I see the entry in question...  Yes, I see it now.  It shall take me some time to devise a plan, even with this new information.
adventure=ch5-15;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Then I shall leave you to your studying, wise one.
nxtln1=morbidicon2

[morbidicon2]
Say=Hmm...  What?  Oh!  Yes, of course, %playername%.  Pardon me, for I have much studying to do.  I knew I should have paid more attention to this book, but I have so many...  [His gaze drifts over the book.  Surprised, he flips through many pages before looking back at you.]  Please come back soon, %playername%, this book is better ordered than I had originally thought, and this will not take so long after all.
RspDflt=I understand, Elarath.  I shall return to you in a short while to check your progress.

[jaropen]
Say=Oh!  Excellent, as a matter of fact!  It turned out being a great deal simpler than a lich stone.  It didn't take me long to find the entry I sought, and I quickly discovered a rather simple solution.  Simple, compared to the work I did on the portal.  Quiet, too, with no spectacular displays.  I'll spare you the specifics, but the heart jar is open and the Queen's soul has been released.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What happens to a soul after it is released from a heart jar?
nxtln1=jaropen2

[jaropen2]
Say=It is an unnatural state, as I'm sure you can imagine, to have one's soul outside of one's own body.  The soul, as it is, always stays within the body that holds the spark of life.  If it is removed, it seeks a way back, hence the invisible silver cords that tie an astrally projected person back to his or her physical body.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Are you saying that the soul has returned to her body of its own volition?  How will the Queen be affected?
nxtln1=jaropen3

[jaropen3]
Say=Indeed, it has, and she's likely to be completely bewildered.  The King will probably think her ill, or perhaps that the moon is affecting her.  I would suggest, as always, discretion -- the Queen will need time to recover from this experience, especially because she is probably clueless about what has been done.

Say=Oh, I thought I had told you.  Keeping it open, while not dangerous any longer, does tax me a bit due to the spells needed to activate it after such a period of inactivity.  It is ancient and needs a sort of maintenance, if you will.  Regardless, your business there is finished, %playername%, and I feel a portent of things to come that conveys to me that we must all be at our best...

RspDflt=I am glad to hear that, Elarath.  Farewell; I have somewhat urgent business to attend to.

[nplayfive5]
Say=Belief in such things is precisely what places you in such high esteem in Avalon.  It is well-placed, %playername%; although an individual certainly cannot win the war, a leader and his people certainly can.

RspTxt1=Indeed, he seems to be getting much worse, and Brother Crosby doesn't think he will last much longer.

Say=I will gladly aid a brother mage, %playername%.  I would prefer to see him personally, but I do not feel comfortable leaving my lab now.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=From what you've heard, what would you suspect is harming him?

Say=Your aid to our mages has been most commendable, %playername% -- freeing Felious's spirit was particularly impressive.  In light of your efforts, I would shame myself if I didn't do what I can.

RspTxt1=From what you've heard, what would you suspect is harming him?
nxtln1=wassawrong

[wassawrong]
Say=It's hard to say, especially without seeing him, but recent events lead me to believe that this must be some type of hostile magic assualt.  These things can be very tricky to determine.  What specific signs of illness has he displayed of late?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=According to Brother Crosby, his hands and head are ice-cold, while his chest is burning up.  He has been completely out of his wits or unconscious most of the time lately.
nxtln1=bebop

[bebop]
Say=This is most unusual.  I have a tome which may shed some light on the matter.  [He snaps his fingers and a tome appears in his hand.]  Let me see... it should be here somewhere... mystical illnesses... yes! This sounds like exactly what you were describing...

RspTxt1=What have you found?
NxtLn1=nchsix
RspCnd2=All(ttl(05chapter5))
RspTxt2=What have you found?
NxtLn2=chsix

[chsix]
Say=It is a very ancient curse, slow and debilitating at first, which will consume even the most powerful mage.  Judging from its age and obscurity -- and the most likely responsible party for the curse -- I'd say the Sha'ahoul picked it up from the Naga, or else happened upon it during their brief excursion into the Astral Plane.

RspTxt1=Pell was helpful in our last venture to the Astral Plane.  Maybe she can help us with this matter, or we could try contacting the Astral Guardian.
nxtln1=c62

[c62]
Say=Unfortunately I cannot contact Aenea, for I have closed the portal to conserve my own energies.  As for Pell, I've not seen much of her since that Fornaxan Magistrate came to Avalon.  No, I'm afraid we'll have to muddle through this on our own.  Fortunately, I believe I have found what we need.

Say=The instructions are vague in spots, but there is an incantation and two components detailed here.  The incantation must be read by someone "pure of heart, mind, and body" -- A fairly standard requirement, and one you certainly meet.  The components are a bit more odd, and I don't believe I have any of them, but I imagine one of the merchants in and about the castle may have them.  I'd try Rayous or Olon -- they never throw anything away.
adventure=ch6-535;
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What components should I ask them for?
nxtln1=comp

[comp]
Say=You will first need Grimstone Root, which Olon will likely have.  I've heard he uses it in some sort of love tonic; judging from the state of most of our companions in this besieged keep, I imagine he's not used up his supply.  The other component is a pinch of ground Swampfire Flower.  As it is sometimes used in exotic perfumes, Rayous may have it -- Did you know that perfumes were his primary stock before the war?
adventure=ch6-536:
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=How unusual.  What about the incantation?
nxtln1=inc

[inc]
Say=I will transcribe it for you. [does so and hands to you]  It is not overly long or complex, but I fear it may be a very draining experience for you.  Be very careful when you cast this, and make sure Elazar has imbibed the tonic made from the components before you begin.
script=player.addtitle(06recipe);player.additem(recipe);
RspDflt=Thanks for the warning, Elarath.  I'm off to find Olon and Rayous now, for I fear Elazar may not have much time left.  Farewell, and thank you for your timely assistance.

RspTxt2=I have the ingredients from Rayous, but I still must speak with Olon.

RspTxt3=I have the ingredient from Olon, but I still must speak with Rayous.

rspcnd5=all(ttl(05chapter5));
RspTxt5=What have you done to the portal, Elarath?  It is no longer active.
nxtln5=playedfive2

[6ncomplete]
Say=You must have both ingredients to complete the treatment, %playername%.
RspDflt=I will gather them, good wizard, and then do what I can for poor Elazar.

[gotoBC]
Say=Take these ingredients to Brother Crosby.  With them and the incantation, you should be able to help poor Elazar.
RspDflt=You have my most sincere thanks -- as always -- for your assistance, wise mage.

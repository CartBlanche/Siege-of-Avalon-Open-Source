[Penrith]
Say=Hello.  You must be Corvus' brother.  I heard you had come to Avalon.  You have the same coloring and posture he does.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=You're correct, sir.  How do you know Corvus?
NxtLn1=Penrith1

[Penrith1]
Say=We've served together here for some time.  He was under my command until he got a cohort of his own.  Your brother saved my life just a few weeks ago during a night attack.  He blocked a shaft of Sha'man's fire aimed at my back with his shield, and all his trouble earned him was severe burns on his own arm.  I owe him a lot.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm glad my brother has such good friends, sir.
NxtLn1=Penrith2

[Penrith2]
Say=Indeed.  Tell him Penrith says hello, will you?
Adventure=ch1-53;
RspDflt=I will.  May the good spirits protect you.

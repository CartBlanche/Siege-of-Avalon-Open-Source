[Informed]
Say=Hold up, lad.  I don't know if you have heard yet, but there may be trouble with the expedition your brother was on.
AddQuest=ch1-05;
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=What trouble?  What's happened, sir?
NxtLn1=Informed1

[Informed1]
Say=As you know, Corvus was part of a large troop that rode out on a short raid.  The troop was led by General Ovoron, commander of our field forces.  They are overdue, and we've seen no sign of them.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Is Corvus all right?
NxtLn1=Informed2

[Informed2]
Say=I don't know.  A search party just returned.  They'll be reporting to Sir Roth now.  You should go ask around at South Gate.  If anyone has seen anything, they will have seen it from South Gate.  Ask for my friend, Calum.  He'll help you.
Adventure=ch1-55;
Script=player.addtitle(01informed);setprop(onActivate=converse(penrith2));journalentry(penrith); showmessage(Your journal has been updated.,200);
RspDflt=I appreciate your counsel.

[Informed3]
Say=I count your brother among my closest friends and I would insist on joining you in your search if duty allowed, but there is more at stake here and duty has to come first.  I hope you understand -- I know you brother would.
RspDflt=I do understand, sir, and I will let you know if I find anything.

[Informed4]
Say=Good job, lad.  Bloody well done!
RspDflt=Thank you, Penrith.

[Steel]
Say=I count your brother among my closest friends and I would insist on joining you in your search if duty allowed, but there is more at stake here and duty has to come first.  I hope you understand -- I know you brother would.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I understand, sir, but there is another matter that requires your attention.  You see, sir, a cache of steel has been located in the village and-
nxtLn1=Steel1

[Steel1]
Say=Steel, you say?  It was Freeman the Blacksmith who filled your ears with that tale, wasn't it?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Well, yes, sir.  When I was out in the village I simply kept my eyes open, and stumbled across the steel.
nxtLn1=Steel2

[Steel2]
Say=Stumbled across...  Amazing.  I would have sworn the blacksmith was a bit touched in the head to be forever spouting that story, but I guess he was right all along.  Well done.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Yes, sir.  He asked me to ask you to send a few men to get the rest of the steel.  I can tell you exactly where to find it.
nxtLn1=Steel3

[Steel3]
Say=Well, lad, I'd dearly love to.  Steel's more precious than gold these days, but that village just isn't friendly.  One man, such as yourself, may be able to sneak about, but not a whole group.  The area would need to be secure before I'd risk any more men.

AddQuest=ch1-09;
RspDflt=None
rspcnd1=all(ttl(!01areasafe));
RspTxt1=I understand, sir -- the area must be secure.  With your permission, then, since I need to still find my brother, when I return to the village I'll make certain the area around the cache is free of Ahoul.
nxtLn1=Steel4
rspcnd2=all(ttl(01areasafe));
rsptxt2=I understand, sir.  However, I have already cleared out all the Sha'ahoul in the area.
nxtln2=areasecure1

[Steel4]
Say=Fine, lad.  You just be careful.
script=player.addtitle(01MakeAreaSecure);
RspDflt=Of course, sir.  Goodbye.

[AreaSecure]
Say=Well, lad?  Can I send my men to retrieve that steel?
RspDflt=None
rspCnd1=all(ttl(01AreaSafe));
RspTxt1=Yes, sir.  The area is safe.
nxtLn1=AreaSecure1
rspCnd2=all(ttl(!01AreaSafe));
RspTxt2=No, sir, not yet.  I'm still working on clearing the area around the cache of all Ahoul.  I believe that there may be one or two still about.
nxtLn2=NotSecure

[AreaSecure1]
Say=Excellent.  I'll start sending my men out immediately.  The proper weaponry we can make with that steel will save lives once the time for battle comes.  Well done, lad!  The spirits are truly with you!

AddQuest=ch1-10;
script=player.addtitle(01GetSword);
RspDflt=Thank you, sir, but it was just part of my duty.

[NotSecure]
Say=That's okay, lad.  I know you brother has got you worried.  When it's safe, just let me know.
RspDflt=Yes, sir.  Thank you, sir.

[penrith]
Say=Look who we have here!  I had wondered where you had disappeared to.  How is your brother?
RspDflt=My apologies, Penrith.  I must have gotten lost.
RspTxt1=In point of fact, it's been a little while since I've seen him, but he's getting better by the day.
nxtln1=penrith2

[penrith2]
Say=That's great.  I saw him a while back, but figured you'd seen him sooner.  It's about time he took some time off, I think.  He always was so determined; I'm sure it won't be long before he's back on duty, if he isn't right now!  Ah, but you didn't come here to listen to an old fool's ramblings.  Can I help you with something?
RspDflt=none
rspcnd1=all(ttl(03mabonquest,!03mabondone,!03reportgiven):obj(!statuspenrith));
RspTxt1=As a matter of fact, you can.  You must have heard that Sir Mabon has been chosen as Ovoron's replacement...
nxtln1=penrith3
RspTxt2=Yes, I was wondering if you could answer a few questions for me...
nxtln2=penrith5

[penrith3]
Say=Ah, yes, Sir Mabon.  I believe he shall do a fine job in his new position; he's an ambitious person.  Oh, I'm sorry, I interrupted you.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Quite all right.  Well, Ovoron seems to have left his office in a state of disarray, and some documents are missing.  Sir Mabon has sent me to you to retrieve your regional status report.
nxtln1=penrith4

[penrith4]
Say=Oh, the Troop Placement Status report?  Of course.  Is there anything else I can do for you?
script=player.additem(statuspenrith);addtitle(03reportgiven);
adventure=ch3-552
RspDflt=Not at the moment, Penrith.  Thank you for your time.
RspTxt1=Yes, you can answer a few questions...
nxtln1=penrith5

[penrith5]
Say=[groan]  Not this again, I...
RspDflt=I was just joking, Penrith.  Take care of yourself.

[chapter5]
Say=%playername%! I see you are running about as always.
RspDflt=Sorry, I have to go.
RspTxt1=Have you heard anything new?
nxtln1=chapter5b
RspTxt2=Do you feel like answering some questions?
nxtln2=penrith5

[chapter5b]
Say=Nothing but the constant moans and yelling from the Peasants' Bailey.   I trust in our good monks, but, if the siege doesn't end soon, I fear we may have no citizens to defend.
RspDflt=As do I. May the spirits protect us all.

[chapter6]
Say=The Peasant's Bailey is unusually quiet today.  The beggars usually crowd around the gate by noon, but I've not seen one today.
RspDflt=Sorry, I have to go.
RspTxt1=Have you heard anything new?
nxtln1=chapter6b

[chapter6b]
Say=They say there's a group of female warriors that have come to help defend Avalon.  I haven't seen them, but the soldiers in East Gate say they're gorgeous!  I love a woman who's strong and beautiful at the same time.
RspDflt=Agreed. Farewell, my amorous friend.

[getasword]
say=Nice work, %playername%!  We've got the last of the Fine Steel and, thanks to you, our blacksmiths shall soon be hard at work!
rspdflt=It was nothing, Penrith.  Farewell.

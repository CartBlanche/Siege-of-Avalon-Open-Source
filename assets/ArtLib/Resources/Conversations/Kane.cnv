[Kane]
Say=Say, have you got a bit of tobacco I could borrow?
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I'm afraid I don't.
NxtLn1=Kane1

[Kane1]
Say=Damn!  I went dry a few days ago and I can't leave this blasted post for days to come.  I suppose there's a shortage of tobacco inside, too.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I imagine there isn't much of anything anymore.
NxtLn1=Kane2

[Kane2]
Say=You're probably right.  It's a filthy habit, anyway.  Good day.
RspDflt=And to you.

[Chalice]
Say=You again!  Why do you keep coming back here?  I assure you there's nothing happening here.
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=I've been going out to the village for different reasons.
NxtLn1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=Then you'd be the soldier that found the Chalice.  You're the hero!
RspDflt=None
RspTxt1=Well, let's just keep that a secret between you and I.
NxtLn1=Chalice2

[Chalice2]
Say=Whatever you say.  Good luck to you, sir.
RspDflt=And to you.

[three]
Say=Hello there, sir.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=What's new, soldier?
nxtln1=three2

[three2]
Say=Not much, but begging your pardon, may I ask you a question?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Certainly not, dog!  I ask the questions around here!
nxtln1=three3
RspTxt2=Of course!
nxtln2=three4

[three3]
Say=As you wish.
RspDflt=As it should be!

[three4]
Say=How is General Roth faring?  A few of us are concerned; we haven't seen him much.
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=Yes, he is well, and plotting the destruction of the Ahoul and the return of peace to our land.
nxtln1=three5

[three5]
Say=That's a relief.  Thank you.
RspDflt=It was nothing.  Farewell.

[chapter6]
Say=I found some tobacco in a box in one of the storage rooms. Want to share it with me?
RspDflt=No, thanks. The smoke of a burning ahoul camp are the fumes I wish to inhale. Farewell.

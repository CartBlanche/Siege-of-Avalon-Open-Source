[quests]
ch1-00=The letter of commission that Corvus obtained for me will grant me the use of some equipment from the Quartermaster.  I need to find the Quartermaster and obtain what I can.  Corvus told me he was located off the corridor north of his quarters.
ch1-01=I am to report to Captain Avarous in the Outer Bailey for training.  I should probably arrive armed.
ch1-02=The head cook Anora has charged me with clearing the basement of unwanted food thieves.
ch1-03=The basement is now clear, but the hole in the basement's wall where the creatures entered needs repair.  Anora has asked me to tell the soldier Davet out in the mess hall to seal the hole.
ch1-04=Davet reluctantly agreed to the repair work.  I should inform Anora of this.
ch1-05=Corvus is missing.  I must find him.  I must!
ch1-06=Lucan of the South Gate Armory has suggested that I ask Freeman the blacksmith about possible shipments of fine steel with which to craft a decent weapon for me.  Freeman should be located in the Outer Bailey.
ch1-07=Freeman, the blacksmith in the Outer Bailey, has informed me that there is possibly a cache of fine steel somewhere in the village.  If I find it, I am to return a bar of it to him.  He has promised me a fine steel blade if I complete this task for him.
ch1-08=Despite my returning a bar of fine steel to him, and telling him where the rest of the cache may be found, Freeman has not yet given to me my sword.  He insists that I ask Sir Penrith to detail some men to fetch him the rest of the cache before granting me the prize.  Sir Penrith should be in the Outer Bailey.
ch1-09=Sir Penrith will not send any men to retrieve the cache of steel until the area around the cache is completely cleared of marauding Ahoul.
ch1-10=With the safety of his men assured, Sir Penrith has agreed to fetch the blacksmith his fine steel.  I should now claim my reward from Freeman.
ch1-11=Sir Roth has transferred me to Mudam's command.  I must present my letter of transfer to Mudam before this takes effect, however.  His room is at the opposite end of the western corridor to Sir Roth's.
ch1-12=Mudam has agreed to permit me outside Avalon's walls to search for my brother.  I am also to report to him anything unusual that I may encounter.
ch1-13=Olon will not tell me what he knows of the village until I help a friend of his named Pell.  She can be found watching the horses in the Outer Bailey.
ch1-14=The lady Pell is in grievous straits.  She would like me to speak with Lahren, her love, about his feelings toward her.  Lahren can be found near the merchants in the South Bailey.
ch1-15=I have informed Lahren that I would talk with Pell, and so this I must do.
ch1-16=I must convince Lahren to talk with Pell, but if he will not confess his love to her, then perhaps he would ask her forgiveness?  I can think of no sure way to do this, however.  I shall have to talk with Lahren and hope for the best.
ch1-17=I have managed to half-convince Lahren to ask for Pell's forgiveness if I can bring to him a suitable gift to give Pell.  But what gift, and where would I find it?  I should tell Pell of this, and perhaps Olon would have a suggestion or two.
ch1-18=I will need to search out more than just Corvus in the village--it seems my best hope for an appropriate gift for Lahren to give to Pell lies there.  Something precious would be best, but I do not know if the Ahoul carry with them anything of value.
ch1-19=Lahren has finally agreed to speak with Pell directly.  I must inform Pell of the good news, and also speak with Olon about the completion of his favor.
ch1-20=Olon wishes me to find a mostly intact house in the village, and ascertain the condition of a locked chest inside.  One would think that such a house would stand out among the desolate ruins.
ch1-21=Olon would like me to present to him the key ring which opened the chest in his house.  He says I may keep the magical boots inside the chest.
ch1-22=Brother Mo asked that I find for him the fruit of an herb that grows in the village orchard.  This can be used to cure a fever running rampant in the infirmary and endangering the lives of many of Avalon's wounded.
ch1-23=Elarath the wizard has told me of an amulet lost in the village and would like me to find it for him.  Unfortunately, his suggestion that the amulet would still be lying beside the broken cart it spilled from is likely rather naive.  I shall, however, keep my eyes open for an amulet.
ch1-24=The amulet I found in the village was not the correct one.  Elarath suggested I talk to Elazar, the wizard in the upper part of the South Gate.
ch1-25=Friar Massus of the Outer Keep's chapel told me of a Chalice that was lost when the village was evacuated to Avalon.  It is a magical artifact, and is likely hidden somewhere inside the village's Church.  I should return the Chalice to the Friar when I locate it.
ch1-26=I have found my brother alive but not well.  We must return to Avalon as quickly as possible to relate to Sir Roth the news Corvus bears.
ch1-27=Sir Roth bid me to make a final report to Mudam before getting some sleep.  First, though, I should deliver Corvus into the hands of the healers.  Brother Crosby is the best of them, so it is to him that I shall speak.
Ch1-28=Mudam suggested that I speak with Olon for further information concerning the village.  Olon should be located in the South Bailey, near the merchants.
ch1-500=Investigate the destination of the tunnel the Sha'ahoul were digging to Avalon, likely somewhere beneath South Gate.
ch1-501=Traitors in South Gate were digging a tunnel leading outside of Avalon!  I must report this to Mudam at once!

tlq8=I have been requested to find a way to assist the Lurkers in becoming human again.
tlq9=The scout's ghost has charged me with destroying the beast her body has become.
tlq10=Wacian, the commander of the watch, has charged me with telling his employee Weldon that his replacement is on its way.  Once I inform the man of this, I should inform Wacian of it, as he has suggested he might just lock me down there...

[Octave]
Say=I am sorry, sir, but I can't let you pass.  Lord Harold has ordered the Peasants' Bailey off limits.
Adventure=ch1-60;
RspDflt=A shame.  I'll be on my way, then.
RspTxt1=Lord Harold, you say?  I see.  I'm new around here.  What's the news?
NxtLn1=Octave1
RspTxt2=Where are you from?
NxtLn2=Octave2

[Octave1]
Say=The Ahoul have been patrolling around South Gate more.  They are definitely up to something.
RspDflt=We will be ready for them.
rspback=Octave

[Octave2]
Say=I was born in Oriam, sir.  My father had a trading post on the frontier that I inherited.  The Sha'ahoul burned it years ago.  That's why I fight -- there is nothing else for me to do.
RspDflt=We are glad to have your help, soldier.
rspback=Octave

[Chalice]
Say=There's the hero!  Is there something I can get for you?
RspDflt=No, thank you.
RspTxt1=Have you heard any rumors?
NxtLn1=Chalice1

[Chalice1]
Say=Get in line at supper tonight early.  There's fresh bread tonight!
RspDflt=Thanks for the tip.

[three]
Say=Isn't it a wonderful day?
RspDflt=Yes, and I've much to do.  Pardon me.
RspTxt1=What did you say?
nxtln1=three2

[three2]
Say=I said it's a wonderful day, why, don't you agree with me?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=I don't disagree with you, it's just strange to hear someone... anyone... be so optimistic considering our situation.
nxtln1=three3

[three3]
Say=Is that bad?  Do you think I'm going soft?  I've gone soft!  Hey, you wanna fight?
RspDflt=none
RspTxt1=There's no need for that.  You might get Mulduc to spar with you, if you can find him.  I haven't the time.
nxtln1=three4

[three4]
Say=Hey, that's a good idea!
RspDflt=Glad to help.  Farewell.

[chapter6]
Say=Say, do you want some of this candy?  I bought a whole box of it from some gypsies before I became trapped inside these walls.  I've eaten some before, and it's strange, but seems harmless.  I used to give a few pieces to the peasant children every day, but now I can't stand to look them in the eyes any more.  Maybe if I eat it all I won't have to go in there.
RspDflt=Pull yourself together, soldier.  We are doing all we can.
RspTxt1=I'm sorry, but I must decline your offer.  Keep faith and skill, brother.

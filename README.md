#Siege of Avalon : Open Source#

The aim of this project is to port the original Win32 Delphi code, over to C# using MonoGame and XNA, so that it can be enjoyed by more people. When complete the plan is to release on Windows Phone, iOS, Android, MacOS, Linux and via PlayStation Suite (PS Vita, Xperia phones and eventually PS3).

If you are an ex-Delphi developer and fancy writing a flexible 2.5D isometric engine in C# using XNA, this is your opportunity. The beauty is that assets already exist, so once the game engine is done, it should hopefully be fairly easy to integrate the assets.
